      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.1\"></a>NARRATIVE OF A. GORDON PYM</h2>\n<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>\n<p>\n      Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the\n      extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere, of\n      which an account is given in the following pages, accident threw me into\n      the society of several gentlemen in Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest\n      in all matters relating to the regions I had visited, and who were\n      constantly urging it upon me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the\n      public. I had several reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of\n      which were of a nature altogether private, and concern no person but\n      myself; others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was\n      that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which\n      I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write, from mere memory, a\n      statement so minute and connected as to have the <i>appearance</i>of that\n      truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and unavoidable\n      exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have\n      had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another\n      reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so\n      positively marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily\n      be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a half-breed\n      Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family, and those of my\n      friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith in my veracity—the\n      probability being that the public at large would regard what I should put\n      forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own\n      abilities as a writer was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which\n      prevented me from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest interest in\n      my statement, more particularly in regard to that portion of it which\n      related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe, lately editor of the\n      “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly magazine, published by Mr. Thomas\n      W. White, in the city of Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others,\n      to prepare at once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and\n      trust to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with\n      great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere authorship, my\n      book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if there were any, would give\n      it all the better chance of being received as truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to do as he\n      suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would not stir in the\n      matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a narrative\n      of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded by myself,\n      publishing it in the “Southern Messenger” <i>under the garb of fiction.\n     </i>To this, perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that\n      my real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended fiction\n      appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January and February\n      (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction, the\n      name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of\n      the magazine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to\n      undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in\n      question; for I found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been so\n      ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in\n      the “Messenger” (without altering or distorting a single fact), the public\n      were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters\n      were sent to Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the\n      contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of\n      such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own\n      authenticity, and that I had consequently little to fear on the score of\n      popular incredulity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This <i>exposé</i>being made, it will be seen at once how much of what\n      follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood that\n      no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by Mr.\n      Poe. Even to those readers who have not seen the “Messenger,” it will be\n      unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences; the\n      difference in point of style will be readily perceived.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\nA.

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.2\"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>\n<p>\n      My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader in\n      sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal grandfather was an\n      attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in every thing, and had\n      speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New Bank, as it was\n      formerly called. By these and other means he had managed to lay by a\n      tolerable sum of money. He was more attached to myself, I believe, than to\n      any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his\n      property at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of\n      old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners—he\n      is well known to almost every person who has visited New Bedford. I stayed\n      at his school until I was sixteen, when I left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s\n      academy on the hill. Here I became intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a\n      sea-captain, who generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.\n      Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many relations, I\n      am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus, and he was nearly two\n      years older than myself. He had been on a whaling voyage with his father\n      in the John Donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in\n      the South Pacific Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain\n      all day, and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would\n      be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories of the\n      natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited in his\n      travels. At last I could not help being interested in what he said, and by\n      degrees I felt the greatest desire to go to sea. I owned a sailboat called\n      the Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or\n      cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she\n      would hold ten persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the\n      habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I now\n      think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive to-day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer\n      and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party at Mr.\n      Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated\n      toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I took part of his bed in\n      preference to going home. He went to sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it\n      being near one when the party broke up), and without saying a word on his\n      favorite topic. It might have been half an hour from the time of our\n      getting in bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly\n      started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep\n      for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so glorious a breeze\n      from the southwest. I never was so astonished in my life, not knowing what\n      he intended, and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set\n      him entirely beside himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however,\n      saying he knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more\n      sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a\n      fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and dress, and go out\n      on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell what possessed me, but the\n      words were no sooner out of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest\n      excitement and pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most\n      delightful and most reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost\n      a gale, and the weather was very cold—it being late in October. I\n      sprang out of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was\n      quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed\n      like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus\n      Barnard in Nantucket.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat.\n      She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of Pankey &amp;\n      Co., and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs. Augustus got\n      into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water. This being\n      done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to\n      sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The night was\n      very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I stationed myself\n      by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew along at a great rate—neither\n      of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf. I now asked\n      my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it\n      probable we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said\n      crustily: “<i>I</i> am going to sea—<i>you</i> may go home if you\n      think proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in\n      spite of his assumed <i>nonchalance</i>, he was greatly agitated. I could\n      see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was paler than\n      any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely\n      retain hold of the tiller. I found that something had gone wrong, and\n      became seriously alarmed. At this period I knew little about the\n      management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical\n      skill of my friend. The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast\n      getting out of the lee of the land—still I was ashamed to betray any\n      trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I\n      could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the\n      propriety of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he\n      made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he at\n      length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar\n      reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me\n      with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked at the speaker\n      attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so\n      violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand. “For God’s sake,\n      Augustus,” I screamed, now heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what\n      is the matter?—what <i>are</i> you going to do?” “Matter!” he\n      stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the\n      same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why,\n      nothing is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t\n      you see?” The whole truth now flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised\n      him up. He was drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either\n      stand, speak, or see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go\n      in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the\n      bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that, during the\n      evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his conduct in\n      bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a\n      state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the\n      outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The coolness\n      of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the mental\n      energy began to yield before its influence—and the confused\n      perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had\n      assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now thoroughly insensible,\n      and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The fumes of\n      the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and\n      irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of managing the boat,\n      and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to\n      destruction. A storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither\n      compass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present\n      course, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts,\n      with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a\n      bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the\n      possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going through the water\n      at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef in either jib\n      or mainsail—running her bows completely under the foam. It was a\n      thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus having let go the\n      tiller, as I said before, and I being too much agitated to think of taking\n      it myself. By good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually I\n      recovered some degree of presence of mind. Still the wind was increasing\n      fearfully, and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell\n      combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly\n      benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At\n      length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to the\n      mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected, it flew over\n      the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried away the mast short\n      off by the board. This latter accident alone saved me from instant\n      destruction. Under the jib only, I now boomed along before the wind,\n      shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter, but relieved from the\n      terror of immediate death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater\n      freedom as I found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate\n      escape. Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as\n      there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly a foot\n      deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him partially up, and keep\n      him in a sitting position, by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing\n      it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy. Having thus arranged every\n      thing as well as I could in my chilled and agitated condition, I\n      recommended myself to God, and made up my mind to bear whatever might\n      happen with all the fortitude in my power.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long\n      scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to\n      pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. Never while I live\n      shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that moment.\n      My hair stood erect on my head—I felt the blood congealing in my\n      veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once\n      raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, I tumbled headlong and\n      insensible upon the body of my fallen companion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the\n      Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons were standing over me, and\n      Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands. Upon\n      seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited\n      alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were\n      present. The mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We\n      had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled, beating up\n      to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set, and consequently\n      running almost at right angles to our own course. Several men were on the\n      look-out forward, but did not perceive our boat until it was an\n      impossibility to avoid coming in contact—their shouts of warning\n      upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was\n      told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel\n      would have passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible\n      impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of the victim—there\n      was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and\n      water, as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along\n      the keel of her destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which\n      it will be remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as\n      useless, the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for\n      proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the\n      matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore positively to\n      having seen some person at our helm, and represented the possibility of\n      yet saving him. A discussion ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a\n      while, said that “it was no business of his to be eternally watching for\n      egg-shells; that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and\n      if there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he might\n      drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect. Henderson, the first\n      mate, now took the matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole\n      ship’s crew, at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity.\n      He spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he\n      considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey\n      his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore.\n      He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer) on one\n      side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice, Hard-a-lee!\n      The men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly about. All this\n      had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to be hardly within\n      the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved—allowing\n      any to have been on board the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both\n      Augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been\n      brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune\n      which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of\n      Providence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and\n      jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having\n      seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon\n      still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward,\n      and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out to\n      his crew to back water. He would say nothing else—repeating his cry\n      impatiently, back water! back water! The men put back as speedily as\n      possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under\n      headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions to take\n      in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the\n      main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another huge lurch now\n      brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her\n      keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough. The body\n      of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth\n      and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and\n      beating violently against it with every movement of the hull. After\n      several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at\n      the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally disengaged from my\n      perilous situation and taken on board—for the body proved to be my\n      own. It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a\n      passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under\n      the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The\n      head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize\n      jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck, forcing itself out\n      between two sinews and just below the right ear. I was immediately put to\n      bed—although life seemed to be totally extinct. There was no surgeon\n      on board. The captain, however, treated me with every attention—to\n      make amends, I presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious\n      behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although the\n      wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not been gone many minutes\n      when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly afterward one\n      of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at\n      intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen\n      to persevere in their search for more than half an hour, although repeated\n      signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although every\n      moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most\n      imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly impossible to conceive how\n      the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single\n      instant. She was built, however, for the whaling service, and was fitted,\n      as I have since had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of\n      some life-boats used on the coast of Wales.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned, it\n      was determined to get back to the ship. They had scarcely made this\n      resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly\n      by. They pursued and soon overtook it. It proved to be the entire deck of\n      the Ariel’s cuddy. Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last\n      agonies. Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a\n      rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I had\n      myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for the purpose\n      of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing, it appeared, had\n      been ultimately the means of preserving his life. The Ariel was slightly\n      put together, and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces; the\n      deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was lifted, by the force\n      of the water rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with\n      other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up\n      with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before he\n      could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the nature of\n      the accident which had befallen our boat. At length he became thoroughly\n      aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water. Upon his\n      first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the\n      surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a\n      rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an instant\n      afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his head striking\n      violently against a hard substance, he again relapsed into insensibility.\n      Upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason—this\n      was still, however, in the greatest degree clouded and confused. He now\n      knew that some accident had occurred, and that he was in the water,\n      although his mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some\n      freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly before the\n      wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his back. Of course, as\n      long as he could have retained this position, it would have been nearly\n      impossible that he should be drowned. Presently a surge threw him directly\n      athwart the deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at\n      intervals for help. Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had\n      been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the\n      sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period of his\n      struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel, nor of the\n      matters in connexion with the source of his disaster. A vague feeling of\n      terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. When he\n      was finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as\n      before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin\n      before he became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I\n      was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and after\n      every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half) by\n      vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil—a proceeding\n      suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck, although of an ugly\n      appearance, proved of little real consequence, and I soon recovered from\n      its effects.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning, after\n      encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off Nantucket.\n      Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr. Barnard’s in time for\n      breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over\n      night. I suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to\n      notice our jaded appearance—of course, it would not have borne a\n      very rigid scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the\n      way of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in Nantucket\n      had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors\n      in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty\n      or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my companion, or\n      myself. We two have since very frequently talked the matter over—but\n      never without a shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly\n      confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so\n      excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat he first\n      discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself sinking\n      beneath its influence.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.3\"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>\n<p>\n      In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences with\n      entire certainty, even from the most simple data. It might be supposed\n      that a catastrophe such as I have just related would have effectually\n      cooled my incipient passion for the sea. On the contrary, I never\n      experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the\n      life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.\n      This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my memory the\n      shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably exciting points\n      of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous accident. My\n      conversations with Augustus grew daily more frequent and more intensely\n      full of interest. He had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean\n      (more than one half of which I now suspect to have been sheer\n      fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic\n      temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is\n      strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the\n      life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering\n      and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had a limited sympathy.\n      My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of death or captivity among\n      barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some\n      gray and desolate rock, in an ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such\n      visions or desires—for they amounted to desires—are common, I\n      have since been assured, to the whole numerous race of the melancholy\n      among men—at the time of which I speak I regarded them only as\n      prophetic glimpses of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to\n      fulfil. Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. It is probable,\n      indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial interchange\n      of character.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster, the firm\n      of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the\n      Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were engaged in repairing and\n      fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage. She was an old hulk,\n      and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be done. I\n      hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels\n      belonging to the same owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was\n      appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him. While the brig\n      was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the\n      opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He found me by\n      no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could not be so easily\n      arranged. My father made no direct opposition; but my mother went into\n      hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all, my\n      grandfather, from whom I expected much, vowed to cut me off with a\n      shilling if I should ever broach the subject to him again. These\n      difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to\n      the flame. I determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my\n      intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it might be\n      accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any of my relations in\n      regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself ostensibly with my usual\n      studies, it was supposed that I had abandoned the design. I have since\n      frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of\n      displeasure as well as of surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of\n      for the furtherance of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word\n      and action of my life for so long a period of time—could only have\n      been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with\n      which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished visions of\n      travel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged to leave\n      much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the greater part\n      of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some arrangements for his\n      father in the cabin and cabin hold. At night, however, we were sure to\n      have a conference and talk over our hopes. After nearly a month passed in\n      this manner, without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to\n      succeed, he told me at last that he had determined upon everything\n      necessary. I had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose\n      house I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a\n      time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June, 1827), and it\n      was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to sea, my father was to\n      receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend\n      a fortnight with Robert and Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself\n      with the inditing of this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as\n      supposed, for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion,\n      who would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This\n      hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently comfortable\n      for a residence of many days, during which I was not to make my\n      appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make\n      any turning back a matter out of question, I should then, he said, be\n      formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father,\n      he would only laugh heartily at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with\n      by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my\n      parents.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been matured.\n      The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday morning I left the\n      house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed. I went, however, straight\n      to Augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street. It had been\n      our original plan that I should keep out of the way until dark, and then\n      slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it\n      was agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to the\n      wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a thick seaman’s\n      cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person might not be\n      easily recognized. Just as we turned the second corner, after passing Mr.\n      Edmund’s well, who should appear, standing right in front of me, and\n      looking me full in the face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why,\n      bless my soul, Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose\n      dirty cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well as I\n      could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended surprise, and\n      talking in the gruffest of all imaginable tones—“sir! you are a\n      sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first place, bee’nt nothing at all\n      like Goddin, and I’d want you for to know better, you blackguard, than to\n      call my new obercoat a darty one.” For my life I could hardly refrain from\n      screaming with laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman\n      received this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned\n      first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles, then,\n      putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella uplifted. He\n      stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck with a sudden\n      recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled off down the street,\n      shaking all the while with rage, and muttering between his teeth: “Won’t\n      do—new glasses—thought it was Gordon—d—d\n      good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived at\n      our point of destination in safety. There were only one or two of the\n      hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the\n      forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged at\n      Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would remain there until late in the evening,\n      so we had little to apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the\n      vessel’s side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed\n      by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and found no\n      person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable style—a thing\n      somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were four very excellent\n      staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. There was also a large stove,\n      I took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the\n      floor of both the cabin and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet\n      high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable\n      nature than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but\n      little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my concealing\n      myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his own stateroom, which\n      was on the starboard side of the brig, and next to the bulkheads. Upon\n      entering, he closed the door and bolted it. I thought I had never seen a\n      nicer little room than the one in which I now found myself. It was about\n      ten feet long, and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide\n      and convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads there\n      was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a chair, and a set of\n      hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books of voyages and travels. There\n      were many other little comforts in the room, among which I ought not to\n      forget a kind of safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me\n      a host of delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in one\n      corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion of the\n      flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out and again\n      adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to\n      allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the\n      mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I\n      found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper by means\n      of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark lantern,\n      descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow. I did so, and he\n      then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail driven into the\n      under side—the carpet, of course, resuming its original position on\n      the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture being\n      concealed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest\n      difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among\n      which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my eyes became accustomed\n      to the gloom, and I proceeded with less trouble, holding on to the skirts\n      of my friend’s coat. He brought me, at length, after creeping and winding\n      through innumerable narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used\n      sometimes for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and\n      full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on the top\n      of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw matting, piled up\n      as high as the floor of the cabin. In every other direction around was\n      wedged as closely as possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of\n      almost every species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous\n      medley of crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter\n      no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the\n      box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in\n      this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had\n      only one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be\n      removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at\n      which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one of the cabin berths\n      covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of\n      mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at\n      the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting\n      position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were some\n      books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a\n      keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an enormous\n      ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and\n      liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of my little\n      apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than\n      any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now\n      pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and\n      then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark\n      whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my hiding-place\n      throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which\n      was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door\n      leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should be enabled\n      readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any\n      unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took his\n      departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of\n      tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he\n      could contrive to do so without observation. This was on the seventeenth\n      of June.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my\n      hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the\n      purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just\n      opposite the opening. During the whole period I saw nothing of Augustus;\n      but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected\n      to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find\n      opportunities of coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and\n      shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and\n      if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as\n      comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be under weigh\n      in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to let you know, and for\n      fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I shall not have a chance of\n      coming down again for some time—perhaps for three or four days more.\n      All is going on right aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you\n      creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find\n      my watch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to\n      keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been buried—only\n      three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the watch to your\n      box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he went up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in motion,\n      and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage.\n      Satisfied with this idea, I determined to make my mind as easy as\n      possible, and await the course of events until I should be permitted to\n      exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more comfortable,\n      accommodations of the cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving\n      the taper burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through\n      windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after toiling a\n      long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two of a former\n      position. At length I reached the nail, and securing the object of my\n      journey, returned with it in safety. I now looked over the books which had\n      been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the expedition of Lewis and\n      Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia. With this I amused myself for some\n      time, when, growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and\n      soon fell into a sound slumber.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed\n      before I could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my\n      situation. By degrees, however, I remembered all. Striking a light, I\n      looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently, no\n      means of determining how long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and\n      I was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently\n      feeling an almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold\n      mutton, some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found\n      excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a state of\n      absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me great disquietude;\n      for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I experienced upon awakening,\n      I began to suppose that I must have slept for an inordinately long period\n      of time. The close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do\n      with this, and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious\n      results. My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath\n      with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy\n      feelings. Still I could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the\n      trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the watch, contented myself as\n      well as possible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person came\n      to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus of the grossest\n      inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in my jug was\n      reduced to about half a pint, and I was suffering much from thirst, having\n      eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became\n      very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in my books. I was\n      overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of\n      indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence, like that\n      of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold. In the meantime the\n      roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean, and a dull\n      humming sound, which reached my ears as if from an immense distance,\n      convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing. I could not imagine a reason\n      for the absence of Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our\n      voyage to allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to him—but\n      I could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain\n      so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen\n      overboard, and upon this idea I could not dwell with any degree of\n      patience. It was possible that we had been baffled by head winds, and were\n      still in the near vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was\n      forced to abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently\n      gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual inclination\n      to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze\n      on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting that we were still in the\n      neighborhood of the island, why should not Augustus have visited me and\n      informed me of the circumstance? Pondering in this manner upon the\n      difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition, I resolved to wait\n      yet another twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would\n      make my way to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my\n      friend, or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a\n      further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with this\n      thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into\n      a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My dreams were of the most\n      terrific description. Every species of calamity and horror befell me.\n      Among other miseries I was smothered to death between huge pillows, by\n      demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me\n      in their embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully\n      shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and\n      awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me. Immensely tall\n      trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far\n      as the eye could reach. Their roots were concealed in wide-spreading\n      morasses, whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether\n      terrible, beneath. And the strange trees seemed endowed with a human\n      vitality, and waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the\n      silent waters for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most\n      acute agony and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone,\n      amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched a fierce\n      lion of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. With\n      a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible\n      teeth. In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the\n      thunder of the firmament, and I fell impetuously to the earth. Stifling in\n      a paroxysm of terror, I at last found myself partially awake. My dream,\n      then, was not all a dream. Now, at least, I was in possession of my\n      senses. The paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon\n      my bosom—his hot breath was in my ear—and his white and\n      ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance of\n      a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken. The beast, whatever\n      it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate violence,\n      while I lay in an utterly helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition\n      beneath him. I felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me—in\n      a word, that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. My brain swam—I\n      grew deadly sick—my vision failed—even the glaring eyeballs\n      above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at length breathed a\n      faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to die. The sound of my\n      voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal. He precipitated\n      himself at full length upon my body; but what was my astonishment, when,\n      with a long and low whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the\n      greatest eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of\n      affection and joy! I was bewildered, utterly lost in amazement—but I\n      could not forget the peculiar whine of my Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the\n      odd manner of his caresses I well knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden\n      rush of blood to my temples—a giddy and overpowering sense of\n      deliverance and reanimation. I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which\n      I had been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful\n      follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood\n      of the most passionate tears.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest\n      indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. For a long time I\n      found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas; but, by very slow\n      degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and I again called to memory the\n      several incidents of my condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried in\n      vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different\n      conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing\n      that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort by\n      his caresses. Most people love their dogs—but for Tiger I had an\n      affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did any\n      creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had been my inseparable\n      companion, and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the\n      noble qualities for which we value the animal. I had rescued him, when a\n      puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little villain in Nantucket who\n      was leading him, with a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown\n      dog repaid the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from\n      the bludgeon of a street robber.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my ear, that\n      it had again run down; but at this I was not at all surprised, being\n      convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that I had slept, as\n      before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course\n      impossible to say. I was burning up with fever, and my thirst was almost\n      intolerable. I felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water,\n      for I had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern,\n      and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding the jug,\n      however, I discovered it to be empty—Tiger, no doubt, having been\n      tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton, the bone\n      of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. The spoiled meat I\n      could well spare, but my heart sank as I thought of the water. I was\n      feeble in the extreme—so much so that I shook all over, as with an\n      ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. To add to my troubles, the\n      brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which\n      lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block\n      up the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible sufferings\n      from sea-sickness. These considerations determined me to make my way, at\n      all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate relief, before I should be\n      incapacitated from doing so altogether. Having come to this resolve, I\n      again felt about for the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found\n      after some little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I\n      had expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had placed\n      them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding Tiger lie quiet,\n      began at once my journey toward the trap.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent. It was\n      with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along at all, and very frequently\n      my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling prostrate on my\n      face, I would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on\n      insensibility. Still I struggled forward by slow degrees, dreading every\n      moment that I should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the\n      lumber, in which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. At\n      length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could command, I\n      struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an iron-bound\n      crate. The accident only stunned me for a few moments; but I found, to my\n      inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had\n      thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as effectually to block up\n      the passage. With my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch\n      from its position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes\n      and ship-furniture. It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as I was,\n      either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage,\n      or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path on the other side. The\n      former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be\n      thought of without a shudder. In my present weak state of both mind and\n      body, I should infallibly lose my way if I attempted it, and perish\n      miserably amid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I\n      proceeded, therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining\n      strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to clamber over\n      the crate.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the undertaking even a\n      more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. On each side of the\n      narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which the\n      least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head;\n      or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked\n      up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the\n      obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box, upon which\n      no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by every means in my\n      power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled to draw\n      myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that my strength\n      would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over, and it\n      was better in every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate\n      effort to force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in\n      the side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks, and\n      found that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife, which,\n      luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour, in prying it\n      entirely off; and getting it through the aperture, discovered, to my\n      exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the opposite side—in\n      other words, that the top was wanting, it being the bottom through which I\n      had forced my way. I now met with no important difficulty in proceeding\n      along the line until I finally reached the nail. With a beating heart I\n      stood erect, and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the\n      trap. It did not rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with\n      somewhat more determination, still dreading lest some other person than\n      Augustus might be in his state-room. The door, however, to my\n      astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for I knew\n      that it had formerly required but little or no effort to remove it. I\n      pushed it strongly—it was nevertheless firm: with all my strength—it\n      still did not give way: with rage, with fury, with despair—it set at\n      defiance my utmost efforts; and it was evident, from the unyielding nature\n      of the resistance, that the hole had either been discovered and\n      effectually nailed up, or that some immense weight had been placed upon\n      it, which it was useless to think of removing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I attempted\n      to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed. I could summon\n      up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the floor, gave way,\n      unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths\n      of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as\n      the prominent disasters to be encountered. At length there returned to me\n      some portion of presence of mind. I arose, and felt with my fingers for\n      the seams or cracks of the aperture. Having found them, I examined them\n      closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the state-room; but\n      none was visible. I then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them,\n      until I met with some hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it\n      to be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed\n      the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The only course now\n      left me was to retrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad\n      fate, or try so to tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some\n      plan of escape. I immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after\n      innumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly exhausted,\n      upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and\n      seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles,\n      and urging me to bear them with fortitude.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my attention.\n      After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would suddenly cease\n      doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon reaching out my hand toward him, I\n      then invariably found him lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. This\n      conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no\n      manner account for it. As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he\n      had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I examined\n      them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I then supposed him\n      hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he devoured with avidity—afterward,\n      however, resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was\n      suffering, like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting\n      this conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I had\n      as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly be a wound\n      upon some portion of his body or head. The latter I felt carefully over,\n      but found nothing. On passing my hand, however, along his back, I\n      perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it.\n      Probing this with my finger, I discovered a string, and tracing it up,\n      found that it encircled the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came\n      across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which\n      the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately\n      beneath the left shoulder of the animal.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.4\"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>\n<p>\n      The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from\n      Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent\n      his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of\n      acquainting me with the true state of affairs. Trembling with eagerness, I\n      now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers. I had a\n      confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before\n      falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the trap, I\n      had been able to remember the exact spot where I had deposited them. But\n      now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself for a full\n      hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles; never,\n      surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. At\n      length, while groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the\n      opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint glimmering of\n      light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly surprised, I endeavored to\n      make my way toward it, as it appeared to be but a few feet from my\n      position. Scarcely had I moved with this intention, when I lost sight of\n      the glimmer entirely, and, before I could bring it into view again, was\n      obliged to feel along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original\n      situation. Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found that, by\n      proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite direction to that in\n      which I had at first started, I was enabled to draw near the light, still\n      keeping it in view. Presently I came directly upon it (having squeezed my\n      way through innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from\n      some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its\n      side. I was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell\n      upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by\n      the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply\n      of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of\n      Augustus. The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other\n      rubbish in the barrel, that I despaired of deriving any service from them,\n      and left them as they were. The phosphorus, of which there was only a\n      speck or two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it,\n      after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while remained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark that I\n      could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face. The white\n      slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when I looked\n      at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina toward it—that\n      is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found that it became in\n      some measure perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and\n      the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only\n      likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no purpose my\n      already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I revolved in my brain a\n      multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light—such expedients\n      precisely as a man in the perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt\n      to fall upon for a similar purpose—each and all of which appear by\n      turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of\n      conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker,\n      alternately, one above the other. At last an idea occurred to me which\n      seemed rational, and which gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I\n      had not entertained it before. I placed the slip of paper on the back of a\n      book, and, collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had\n      brought from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with\n      the palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A clear\n      light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had\n      there been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the least\n      difficulty, I am sure, in reading it. Not a syllable was there, however—nothing\n      but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few\n      seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period\n      prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. There\n      were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and\n      then, even of energy; but these were few. It must be remembered that I had\n      been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere\n      of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time\n      but scantily supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I\n      had none—nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the\n      most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss of the\n      mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the sea-biscuit; and\n      these latter were utterly useless to me, as they were too dry and hard to\n      be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat. I was now\n      in a high state of fever, and in every respect exceedingly ill. This will\n      account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed\n      after my last adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested\n      itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall not attempt\n      to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was more angry than any\n      thing else) when the egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly\n      upon my perception. The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had\n      not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise—in my\n      disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly\n      torn it in pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the sagacity of\n      Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, I put\n      it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must\n      bring me the rest of it. To my astonishment, (for I had taught him none of\n      the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at\n      once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found\n      another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile, and,\n      rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for my approval\n      of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when he immediately made\n      off again. It was now some minutes before he came back—but when he\n      did come, he brought with him a large slip, which proved to be all the\n      paper missing—it having been torn, it seems, only into three pieces.\n      Luckily, I had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus\n      were left—being guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the\n      particles still emitted. My difficulties had taught me the necessity of\n      caution, and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. It\n      was very probable, I considered, that some words were written upon that\n      side of the paper which had not been examined—but which side was\n      that? Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect,\n      although it assured me that the words (if there were any) would be found\n      all on one side, and connected in a proper manner, as written. There was\n      the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a\n      doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a\n      third attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I placed\n      the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes thoughtfully\n      revolving the matter over in my mind. At last I thought it barely possible\n      that the written side might have some unevenness on its surface, which a\n      delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect. I determined to make\n      the experiment and passed my finger very carefully over the side which\n      first presented itself. Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned\n      the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now again carried my forefinger\n      cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still\n      discernable glow, which followed as it proceeded. This, I knew, must arise\n      from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I\n      had covered the paper in my previous attempt. The other, or under side,\n      then, was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should finally\n      prove to be. Again I turned the note, and went to work as I had previously\n      done. Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before—but\n      this time several lines of MS. in a large hand, and apparently in red ink,\n      became distinctly visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was\n      but momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would have\n      been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before\n      me—for I saw there were three. In my anxiety, however, to read all\n      at once, I succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words, which\n      thus appeared—“blood—your life depends upon lying close.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note—the full\n      meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey,\n      that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of disaster\n      the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly convinced, have imbued my\n      mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which\n      I was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received. And “blood,” too,\n      that word of all words—so rife at all times with mystery, and\n      suffering, and terror—how trebly full of import did it now appear—how\n      chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words\n      to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid the\n      deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my soul!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain\n      concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be—but\n      I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery.\n      Just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and before my\n      attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of Tiger, I\n      had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those\n      on board, or, if I could not succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my\n      way through the orlop deck. The half certainty which I felt of being able\n      to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had given\n      me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to endure the evils of\n      my situation. The few words I had been able to read, however, had cut me\n      off from these final resources, and I now, for the first time, felt all\n      the misery of my fate. In a paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon\n      the mattress, where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a\n      kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and\n      recollection.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the\n      horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours it was barely\n      possible that I might exist without water—for a longer time I could\n      not do so. During the first portion of my imprisonment I had made free use\n      of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they only served\n      to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging thirst. I had now\n      only about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach liqueur\n      at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were entirely consumed; of the\n      ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin; and all the biscuit,\n      except a few fragments of one, had been eaten by Tiger. To add to my\n      troubles, I found that my headache was increasing momentarily, and with it\n      the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my\n      first falling asleep. For some hours past it had been with the greatest\n      difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so doing was\n      attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of the chest. But there\n      was still another and very different source of disquietude, and one,\n      indeed, whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to\n      exertion from my stupor on the mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the\n      dog.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the\n      phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he ran his nose\n      against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited at the\n      time to pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be\n      remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of\n      lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my\n      ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting and\n      wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs\n      flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him, when he replied with\n      a low growl, and then remained quiet. Presently I relapsed into my stupor,\n      from which I was again awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated\n      three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great\n      a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying close by\n      the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone,\n      and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. I had no doubt whatever\n      that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven\n      him mad, and I was at a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the\n      thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own\n      safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an\n      expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that\n      he would attack me. At last I could endure my terrible situation no\n      longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and\n      dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do\n      so. To get out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already\n      seemed to anticipate my design—missing himself upon his fore-legs\n      (as I perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the\n      whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the\n      remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and\n      secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which\n      Augustus had left me—then, folding my cloak around me as closely as\n      possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No sooner did I\n      do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole\n      weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently\n      to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had\n      fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these\n      protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp\n      teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck—yet,\n      luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. I was now beneath\n      the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. Despair\n      gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force,\n      and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw\n      over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the\n      door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this struggle,\n      however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found\n      my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. As this\n      reflection crossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of\n      perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in\n      similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to\n      the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my name\n      pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of\n      the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was\n      the emotion excited within me by the sound, that I endeavoured in vain to\n      reply. My powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest\n      my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach\n      me, I stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling\n      convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had a thousand\n      words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken it. There was a\n      slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my\n      station. The sound presently grew less distinct, then again less so, and\n      still less. Shall I ever forget my feelings at this moment? He was going—my\n      friend, my companion, from whom I had a right to expect so much—he\n      was going—he would abandon me—he was gone! He would leave me\n      to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and loathesome of\n      dungeons—and one word, one little syllable, would save me—yet\n      that single syllable I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more than ten\n      thousand times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled, and I fell,\n      deadly sick, against the end of the box.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of my\n      pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. Never did any\n      strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! With the\n      intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon\n      Augustus—for I knew that the person who called my name could be no\n      one but himself. All was silent for some moments. At length I again heard\n      the word “Arthur!” repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation.\n      Reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at\n      the top of my voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake be\n      silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will be with\n      you immediately—as soon as I can make my way through the hold.” For\n      a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment seemed\n      to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he placed,\n      at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips. Those only who have been\n      suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known the\n      insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those\n      which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the\n      unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all\n      physical luxuries afforded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced from his\n      pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured with the greatest\n      avidity. He had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and the\n      grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink.\n      But I was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence, and he\n      proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my incarceration.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.5\"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>\n<p>\n      The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he had left\n      the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be remembered that I\n      had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this period, there\n      was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running to and fro,\n      especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no chance of\n      visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered.\n      When at length he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as\n      possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but little\n      uneasiness on my account—still, however, watching an opportunity of\n      going down. It was not until the fourth day that he found one. Several\n      times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know\n      of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we were still within\n      reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions\n      which had escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put\n      back if he discovered me to be on board. Besides, upon thinking the matter\n      over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that I was in immediate\n      want, or that I would hesitate, in such case, to make myself heard at the\n      trap. When, therefore, he considered everything he concluded to let me\n      stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved.\n      This, as I said before, did not occur until the fourth day after his\n      bringing me the watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold.\n      He then went down without taking with him any water or provisions,\n      intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get me to\n      come from the box to the trap,—when he would go up to the stateroom\n      and thence hand me down a supply. When he descended for this purpose he\n      found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was snoring very loudly. From\n      all the calculations I can make on the subject, this must have been the\n      slumber into which I fell just after my return from the trap with the\n      watch, and which, consequently, must have lasted for more than three\n      entire days and nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both\n      from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with\n      the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when\n      closely confined; and when I think of the condition of the hold in which I\n      was imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as\n      a whaling vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after\n      once falling asleep, than that I should have slept uninterruptedly for the\n      period specified above.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap—but\n      I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and spoke to me in a louder,\n      and finally in a very loud tone—still I continued to snore. He was\n      now at a loss what to do. It would take him some time to make his way\n      through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would be\n      noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his services every\n      minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the\n      voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and await\n      another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily induced to this\n      resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature, and he\n      could not suppose that I had undergone any inconvenience from my\n      incarceration. He had just made up his mind on these points when his\n      attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded\n      apparently from the cabin. He sprang through the trap as quickly as\n      possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. No sooner\n      had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face,\n      and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from a handspike.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon his\n      throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him. His father\n      was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the companion-way,\n      with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead, from which the blood\n      was flowing in a continued stream. He spoke not a word, and was apparently\n      dying. Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of\n      fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from which he\n      presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer. Seven of the crew\n      (among whom was the cook, a negro) were rummaging the staterooms on the\n      larboard for arms, where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and\n      ammunition. Besides Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men\n      altogether in the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s\n      company. The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with them after\n      having secured his arms behind his back. They proceeded straight to the\n      forecastle, which was fastened down—two of the mutineers standing by\n      it with axes—two also at the main hatch. The mate called out in a\n      loud voice: “Do you hear there below? tumble up with you, one by one—now,\n      mark that—and no grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one\n      appeared:—at last an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came\n      up, weeping piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner,\n      to spare his life. The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe.\n      The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook\n      lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately\n      into the sea. Hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below\n      could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises,\n      until a proposition was made to smoke them out. A general rush then\n      ensued, and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be\n      retaken. The mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the\n      forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get\n      up. These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms,\n      submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair words—no\n      doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no\n      difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The result proved his\n      sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy. All in the forecastle\n      presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one by\n      one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the first\n      six—there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the\n      mutiny, twenty-seven.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen were\n      dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each\n      victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the\n      other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had\n      given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come\n      next. But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in some\n      measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining\n      prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with\n      the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole\n      murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. They\n      now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay not\n      more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said. Upon some\n      of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for\n      several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether,\n      on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. The black\n      cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and who seemed to\n      exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate himself), would listen\n      to no proposition of the kind, and rose repeatedly for the purpose of\n      resuming his work at the gangway. Fortunately he was so far overcome by\n      intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the\n      party, among whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters.\n      This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who\n      live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near the source of the\n      Missouri. His father was a fur-trader, I believe, or at least connected in\n      some manner with the Indian trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself\n      was one of the most ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in\n      stature, not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of\n      Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick and broad\n      as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as legs, were bowed\n      in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no flexibility\n      whatever. His head was equally deformed, being of immense size, with an\n      indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most negroes), and\n      entirely bald. To conceal this latter deficiency, which did not proceed\n      from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which\n      presented itself—occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or American\n      grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a portion of one of these\n      bearskins; and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his\n      countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka character. The mouth extended\n      nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed, like some other\n      portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling\n      expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. This\n      ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth\n      were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially covered, in\n      any instance, by the lips. To pass this man with a casual glance, one\n      might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter, but a second look would\n      induce a shuddering acknowledgment, that if such an expression were\n      indicative of merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. Of this\n      singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of\n      Nantucket. These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when\n      under excitement, and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his\n      sanity. But on board the Grampus, it seems, he was regarded, at the time\n      of the mutiny, with feelings more of derision than of anything else. I\n      have been thus particular in speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious\n      as he appeared, he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of\n      Augustus, and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him\n      hereafter in the course of my narrative—a narrative, let me here\n      say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include incidents of\n      a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience, and for this\n      reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity, that I proceed in\n      utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that I shall tell, yet\n      confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the\n      most important and most improbable of my statements.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was determined\n      at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of Augustus, whom\n      Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his clerk) should be\n      set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. The mate went down into the\n      cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still living—for, it will be\n      remembered, he was left below when the mutineers came up. Presently the\n      two made their appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat\n      recovered from the effects of his wound. He spoke to the men in a voice\n      hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to return to\n      their duty, and promising to land them wherever they chose, and to take no\n      steps for bringing them to justice. He might as well have spoken to the\n      winds. Two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the\n      brig’s side into the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went\n      below. The four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and\n      ordered to follow, which they did without attempting any resistance—Augustus\n      being still left in his painful position, although he struggled and prayed\n      only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father\n      farewell. A handful of sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed\n      down; but neither mast, sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern\n      for a few minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation—it\n      was then finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on—there\n      were neither moon nor stars visible—and a short and ugly sea was\n      running, although there was no great deal of wind. The boat was instantly\n      out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate\n      sufferers who were in it. This event happened, however, in latitude 35\n      degrees 30’ north, longitude 61 degrees 20’ west, and consequently at no\n      very great distance from the Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore\n      endeavored to console himself with the idea that the boat might either\n      succeed in reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in\n      with by vessels off the coast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original course\n      to the southwest—the mutineers being bent upon some piratical\n      expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to be\n      intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No\n      attention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about\n      anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him with\n      some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality\n      of the cook. His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the\n      men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon their\n      continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself. His anxiety on\n      my account he represented, however, as the most distressing result of his\n      condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his\n      friendship. More than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with\n      the secret of my being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly\n      through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly\n      through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. For the latter\n      purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of the most constant\n      vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any\n      chance occurred. At length, on the night of the third day, there came on a\n      heavy blow from the eastward, and all hands were called up to take in\n      sail. During the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved,\n      and into the stateroom. What was his grief and horror in discovering that\n      the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of\n      sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old\n      chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had\n      been dragged thence to make room for a chest, and were now lying\n      immediately upon the trap! To remove it without discovery was impossible,\n      and he returned on deck as quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate\n      seized him by the throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the\n      cabin, was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was\n      again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus was now\n      put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his\n      feet lashed tightly together. He was then taken into the steerage, and\n      thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the\n      assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again “until the brig\n      was no longer a brig.” This was the expression of the cook, who threw him\n      into the berth—it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning\n      intended by the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate\n      means of my relief, as will presently appear.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.6\"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>\n<p>\n      For some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus\n      abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive. He\n      now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who should\n      come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my chance\n      with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,—for it had\n      been ten days since I was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a\n      plentiful supply even for four. As he was thinking on this subject, the\n      idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to\n      communicate with me by the way of the main hold. In any other\n      circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have\n      prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little\n      prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole mind,\n      therefore, upon the task.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no method of\n      removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very\n      outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be\n      slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience,\n      merely by squeezing his hands through them,—this species of manacle\n      being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the\n      smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his feet, and,\n      leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be readjusted in\n      the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead\n      where it joined the berth. The partition here was of soft pine board, an\n      inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his\n      way through. A voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he\n      had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not\n      been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when\n      Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who immediately leaped into the\n      berth and lay down. The dog had been brought on board by Augustus, who\n      knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to\n      have him with me during the voyage. He went up to our house for him\n      immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of\n      mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny,\n      Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had\n      given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some\n      of the malignant villains belonging to the mate’s gang. It appeared\n      afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from\n      which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself.\n      Peters at last let him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my\n      friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the\n      forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and\n      potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck, promising to come\n      down with something more to eat on the next day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and\n      unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress on which\n      he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had not thought\n      it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of\n      the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor of the berth. He\n      chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to\n      conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into\n      its proper position. For the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance\n      occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank. It should here\n      be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a\n      sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking\n      the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no\n      more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig.\n      These circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for,\n      had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me.\n      As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design. It was near\n      daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board\n      (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture\n      quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main\n      orlop deck. Having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to\n      the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers\n      of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely\n      room enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch he found that Tiger\n      had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks. It was\n      now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief\n      difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold. He\n      therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night. With this\n      design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little\n      detention as possible when he should come again. No sooner had he loosened\n      it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a\n      moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if\n      anxious to remove the covering with his paws. There could be no doubt,\n      from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and\n      Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put\n      him down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was\n      especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out\n      at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of\n      his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events\n      proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for,\n      had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly have\n      fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both\n      our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the materials\n      for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and this by means\n      of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as dark as pitch. Paper\n      enough was obtained from the back of a letter—a duplicate of the\n      forged letter from Mr. Ross. This had been the original draught; but the\n      handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written\n      another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his coat-pocket, where\n      it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink alone was thus wanting, and a\n      substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision\n      with the pen-knife on the back of a finger just above the nail—a\n      copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. The\n      note was now written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the\n      circumstances. It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that\n      Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might expect immediate relief\n      as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon making any\n      disturbance. It concluded with these words: “<i>I have scrawled this with\n      blood—your life depends upon lying close.</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the\n      hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle,\n      where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his\n      absence. To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in just\n      above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. His\n      handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below,\n      very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend’s\n      allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of a dozen large Irish\n      potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He sat for some time on a chest\n      by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general concerns of\n      the brig. His demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque. At\n      one time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct. At last, however, he\n      went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on\n      the morrow. During the day two of the crew (harpooners) came down,\n      accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last stage of\n      intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of talking unreservedly\n      about their plans. It appeared that they were much divided among\n      themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point, except the\n      attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with which they were in\n      hourly expectation of meeting. As far as could be ascertained, the mutiny\n      had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private\n      pique of the chief mate’s against Captain Barnard having been the main\n      instigation. There now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew—one\n      headed by the mate, the other by the cook. The former party were for\n      seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself, and\n      equipping it at some of the West India Islands for a piratical cruise. The\n      latter division, however, which was the stronger, and included Dirk Peters\n      among its partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid\n      out for the brig into the South Pacific; there either to take whale, or\n      act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. The representations of\n      Peters, who had frequently visited these regions, had great weight,\n      apparently, with the mutineers, wavering, as they were, between\n      half-engendered notions of profit and pleasure. He dwelt on the world of\n      novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the\n      Pacific, on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be\n      enjoyed, but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on\n      the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty of the\n      women. As yet, nothing had been absolutely determined upon; but the\n      pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking strong hold upon the\n      ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there was every possibility that\n      his intentions would be finally carried into effect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the\n      forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He then freed\n      himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. A bottle\n      was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the\n      pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold\n      potatoes. To his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small\n      piece of tallow candle in it. This he could light at any moment, as he had\n      in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite dark, he\n      got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the precaution to\n      arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person\n      covered up. When through, he hung up the pea-jacket on his knife, as\n      before, to conceal the aperture—this manoeuvre being easily\n      effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out until\n      afterward. He was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to make his\n      way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to the main\n      hatchway. Having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and descended,\n      groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. In\n      a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the\n      closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible that I had\n      survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an\n      air. He called my name repeatedly, but I made him no reply, and his\n      apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The brig was rolling violently,\n      and there was so much noise in consequence, that it was useless to listen\n      for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing or snoring. He threw\n      open the lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity\n      occurred, in order that, by observing the light, I might, if alive, be\n      aware that succor was approaching. Still nothing was heard from me, and\n      the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty. He\n      determined, nevertheless, to force a passage, if possible, to the box, and\n      at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises. He pushed on\n      for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he\n      found the pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of\n      making any farther way by the course in which he had set out. Overcome now\n      by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber in despair, and wept\n      like a child. It was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by\n      the bottle which I had thrown down. Fortunate, indeed, was it that the\n      incident occurred—for, upon this incident, trivial as it appears,\n      the thread of my destiny depended. Many years elapsed, however, before I\n      was aware of this fact. A natural shame and regret for his weakness and\n      indecision prevented Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more\n      intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. Upon\n      finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he\n      could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me,\n      and return at once to the forecastle. Before condemning him entirely on\n      this head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be\n      taken into consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence\n      from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be\n      so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. His candle was\n      expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty in\n      retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. It must be allowed, too,\n      that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event no\n      benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of\n      danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly\n      called, and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and\n      nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left\n      with me—a supply which it was not at all probable I had hoarded in\n      the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause to expect a speedy\n      release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him,\n      coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature\n      absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me\n      upon my first taking up my quarters in the box—the hatchways at that\n      time having been constantly open for many months previous. Add to these\n      considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately\n      witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes\n      from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still\n      existed—circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every\n      energy of mind—and the reader will be easily brought, as I have\n      been, to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with\n      sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure\n      that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was sufficient\n      inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by means\n      of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of the\n      vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command,\n      regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew. It will be\n      remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but I was so\n      entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply.\n      Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he\n      descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of\n      time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise occasioned\n      by which I heard, as will be recollected. He had made considerable\n      progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to\n      hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately, and, clambering up the\n      stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as before, having\n      watched for a lull. This time I found voice to answer. Overjoyed at\n      discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave every\n      difficulty and danger in reaching me. Having extricated himself as quickly\n      as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at\n      length struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after a\n      series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.7\"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>\n<p>\n      The leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus\n      communicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not until\n      afterward that he entered fully into all the details. He was apprehensive\n      of being missed, and I was wild with impatience to leave my detested place\n      of confinement. We resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the\n      bulkhead, near which I was to remain for the present, while he went\n      through to reconnoiter. To leave Tiger in the box was what neither of us\n      could endure to think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question. He\n      now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish the\n      sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box. I was\n      convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the door. We found him\n      lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor, yet still alive. No\n      time was to be lost, yet I could not bring myself to abandon an animal who\n      had now been twice instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at\n      preserving him. We therefore dragged him along with us as well as we\n      could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue; Augustus, during\n      part of the time, being forced to clamber over the impediments in our way\n      with the huge dog in his arms—a feat to which the feebleness of my\n      frame rendered me totally inadequate. At length we succeeded in reaching\n      the hole, when Augustus got through, and Tiger was pushed in afterward.\n      All was found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to\n      God for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped. For the\n      present, it was agreed that I should remain near the opening, through\n      which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily\n      provision, and where I could have the advantages of breathing an\n      atmosphere comparatively pure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have spoken\n      of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my\n      readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, I must here state\n      that the manner in which this most important duty had been performed on\n      board the Grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of\n      Captain Barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman\n      as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem\n      necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a\n      careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents, even within the\n      limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this\n      particular. Coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant\n      upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from\n      the want of a proper attention to stowage. The great point is to allow no\n      possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most\n      violent rollings of the vessel. With this end, great attention must be\n      paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the nature of the bulk, and\n      whether there be a full or only a partial cargo. In most kinds of freight\n      the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw. Thus, in a load of\n      tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the\n      vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found to be\n      completely flattened, and take some time to regain their original shape.\n      This screwing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of\n      obtaining more room in the hold; for in a full load of any such\n      commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting\n      whatever, at least none from which inconvenience can result. There have\n      been instances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the\n      most lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct\n      from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. A load of cotton, for\n      example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been known,\n      through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at sea. There\n      can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of\n      tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation, were it not\n      for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be\n      apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken to\n      guard against such misfortune. Only those who have encountered a violent\n      gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a\n      sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of\n      the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose\n      articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity of a cautious\n      stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious. When lying-to\n      (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which is not properly\n      modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends; this\n      occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet\n      without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper\n      stowage. If this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the first\n      of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of\n      the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from\n      regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do, she is\n      certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not too much to say\n      that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in\n      heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after being\n      first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a layer of\n      stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel. Upon these\n      boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected, reaching to the\n      timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its place. In cargoes\n      consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are\n      requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be\n      found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its destination—this,\n      too, although the freight, when measured bushel by bushel by the\n      consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on account of the swelling of the\n      grain) the quantity consigned. This result is occasioned by settling\n      during the voyage, and is the more perceptible in proportion to the\n      roughness of the weather experienced. If grain loosely thrown in a vessel,\n      then, is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it will\n      be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most\n      distressing calamities. To prevent these, every method should be employed\n      before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this\n      there are many contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of\n      wedges into the grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains\n      taken to secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about\n      will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of\n      grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. Yet there are\n      hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the\n      ports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most\n      dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever. The wonder is that\n      no more accidents occur than do actually happen. A lamentable instance of\n      this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel\n      Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond, Virginia, to\n      Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The captain had gone many\n      voyages without serious accident, although he was in the habit of paying\n      no attention whatever to his stowage, more than to secure it in the\n      ordinary manner. He had never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on\n      this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much\n      more than half fill the vessel. For the first portion of the voyage he met\n      with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day’s sail of\n      Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E. which forced him to\n      lie-to. He brought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail\n      alone, when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and\n      shipped not a drop of water. Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and\n      she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well,\n      until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. The corn\n      was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement bursting open\n      the main hatchway. The vessel went down like a shot. This happened within\n      hail of a small sloop from Madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the\n      only person saved), and which rode out the gale in perfect security, as\n      indeed a jolly boat might have done under proper management.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage that\n      could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling\n      together of oil-casks {*1} and ship furniture. I have already spoken of\n      the condition of articles in the hold. On the orlop deck there was space\n      enough for my body (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper\n      deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other\n      large spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through the\n      bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and in this\n      space I found myself comfortably situated for the present.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted his\n      handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We had made a narrow escape\n      indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate came\n      below, with Dirk Peters and the cook. They talked for some time about the\n      vessel from the Cape Verds, and seemed to be excessively anxious for her\n      appearance. At length the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was\n      lying, and seated himself in it near the head. I could see and hear every\n      thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not been put back,\n      and I was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the\n      pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal the aperture, in which case all\n      would have been discovered, and our lives would, no doubt, have been\n      instantly sacrificed. Our good fortune prevailed, however; and although he\n      frequently touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it\n      sufficiently to bring about a discovery. The bottom of the jacket had been\n      carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by\n      its swinging to one side. All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the\n      berth, and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for I\n      could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk Peters\n      behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in the\n      place just occupied by the mate. He began to talk very sociably with\n      Augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent\n      intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint. He answered\n      all my companion’s questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no\n      doubt of his father’s having been picked up, as there were no less than\n      five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift; and\n      used other language of a consolatory nature, which occasioned me no less\n      surprise than pleasure. Indeed, I began to entertain hopes, that through\n      the instrumentality of Peters we might be finally enabled to regain\n      possession of the brig, and this idea I mentioned to Augustus as soon as I\n      found an opportunity. He thought the matter possible, but urged the\n      necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the conduct of\n      the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone;\n      and, indeed, it was difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound\n      mind. Peters went upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again\n      until noon, when he brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and\n      pudding. Of this, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without\n      returning through the hole. No one else came down into the forecastle\n      during the day, and at night, I got into Augustus’ berth, where I slept\n      soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon\n      hearing a stir upon deck, and I regained my hiding-place as quickly as\n      possible. When the day was fully broke, we found that Tiger had recovered\n      his strength almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia,\n      drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent\n      eagerness. During the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite.\n      His strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious\n      quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion with canine madness.\n      I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had persisted in bringing him with\n      me from the box. This day was the thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth\n      since the Grampus made sail from Nantucket.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an\n      excessively good-humor. He came to Augustus’s berth, and, giving him a\n      slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he\n      let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin\n      again. To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative, when the\n      ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum\n      which he drew from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck, and I did not\n      see Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the good news\n      that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he pleased\n      anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered to sleep,\n      as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me, too, a good dinner, and a\n      plentiful supply of water. The brig was still cruising for the vessel from\n      the Cape Verds, and a sail was now in sight, which was thought to be the\n      one in question. As the events of the ensuing eight days were of little\n      importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my\n      narrative, I will here throw them into the form of a journal, as I do not\n      wish to omit them altogether.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 3. Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I contrived\n      a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came below, except my\n      companion, during the day. Tiger took his station in the berth just by the\n      aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely recovered from the\n      effects of his sickness. Toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig\n      before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized her. The puff died\n      away immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting of\n      the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated Augustus all this day with great\n      kindness and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the\n      Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited in that region. He asked him\n      whether he would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring\n      and pleasure voyage in those quarters, and said that the men were\n      gradually coming over to the mate’s views. To this Augustus thought it\n      best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure, since\n      nothing better could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a\n      piratical life.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 4th. The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from Liverpool,\n      and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent most of his time on\n      deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting\n      the intentions of the mutineers. They had frequent and violent quarrels\n      among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim Bonner, was thrown\n      overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground. Jim Bonner belonged\n      to the cook’s gang, of which Peters was a partisan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 5th. About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west, which\n      at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry nothing more\n      than her trysail and foresail. In taking in the foretopsail, Simms, one of\n      the common hands, and belonging also to the cook’s gang, fell overboard,\n      being very much in liquor, and was drowned—no attempt being made to\n      save him. The whole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit:\n      Dirk Peters; Seymour, the black cook; Jones, Greely, Hartman Rogers and\n      William Allen, all of the cook’s party; the mate, whose name I never\n      learned; Absalom Hicks, Wilson, John Hunty Richard Parker, of the mate’s\n      party;—besides Augustus and myself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 6th. The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,\n      accompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water through her\n      seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, Augustus being\n      forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a large ship passed close by us,\n      without having been discovered until within hail. The ship was supposed to\n      be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout. The mate hailed\n      her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. At eleven, a\n      sea was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the larboard\n      bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. Toward morning the weather\n      moderated, and at sunrise there was very little wind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 7th. There was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the\n      brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in\n      the hold, as I could hear distinctly from my hiding-place. I suffered a\n      great deal from sea-sickness. Peters had a long conversation this day with\n      Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had gone\n      over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several\n      questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During a\n      part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be\n      done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's straining, and taking\n      in the water through her seams. A sail was thrummed, and got under the\n      bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the\n      leak.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 8th. A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward, when the\n      mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making some\n      of the West India islands in pursuance of his piratical designs. No\n      opposition was made by Peters or the cook—at least none in the\n      hearing of Augustus. All idea of taking the vessel from the Cape Verds was\n      abandoned. The leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every\n      three quarters of an hour. The sail was drawn from beneath the bows. Spoke\n      two small schooners during the day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 9th. Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks. Peters\n      had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke more plainly than\n      he had done heretofore. He said nothing should induce him to come into the\n      mate’s views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his\n      hands. He asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to\n      which Augustus said, “Yes,” without hesitation. Peters then said he would\n      sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. During the\n      remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of speaking with him\n      privately.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.8\"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>\n<p>\n      July 10. Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. Weather hazy, with a\n      light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman Rogers died, having\n      been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog.\n      This man was of the cook’s party, and one upon whom Peters placed his main\n      reliance. He told Augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and\n      that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would\n      come shortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook belonging\n      to his own gang—on the other side there were five. He had spoken to\n      Jones about taking the command from the mate; but the project having been\n      coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing the matter any\n      further, or from saying any thing to the cook. It was well, as it\n      happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the cook expressed\n      his determination of siding with the mate, and went over formally to that\n      party; while Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and\n      hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. There was\n      now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his determination\n      of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards, provided Augustus would\n      lend him his aid. My friend at once assured him of his willingness to\n      enter into any plan for that purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a\n      favourable one, made known the fact of my being on board. At this the\n      hybrid was not more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance\n      whatever upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party\n      of the mate. They went below immediately, when Augustus called to me by\n      name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted. It was agreed that\n      we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity,\n      leaving Jones altogether out of our councils. In the event of success, we\n      were to run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up.\n      The desertion of his party had frustrated Peters’ design of going into the\n      Pacific—an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew,\n      and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score of\n      insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his aid to\n      the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through the\n      representations of Augustus and myself. Our deliberations were interrupted\n      for the present by the cry of, “All hands take in sail,” and Peters and\n      Augustus ran up on deck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be\n      properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. By\n      keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of\n      water. Scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the\n      vessel, and immediately afterward another—no damage being done.\n      There was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came\n      on, with great fury, from the northward and westward. All was made as snug\n      as possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail. As\n      night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy\n      sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with Augustus, and we resumed our\n      deliberations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present\n      for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at such a moment would\n      never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly laid-to, there would be no\n      necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we succeeded in\n      our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us\n      in taking her into port. The main difficulty was the great disproportion\n      in our forces. There were only three of us, and in the cabin there were\n      nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with the\n      exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters had concealed about his\n      person, and the large seaman’s knife which he always wore in the waistband\n      of his pantaloons. From certain indications, too—such, for example,\n      as there being no such thing as an axe or a handspike lying in their\n      customary places—we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions,\n      at least in regard to Peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of\n      getting rid of him. It was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to\n      do could not be done too soon. Still the odds were too much against us to\n      allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into conversation\n      with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to throw him into the sea\n      without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by seizing a good\n      opportunity, that Augustus and myself should then come up, and endeavour\n      to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we\n      should then make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any\n      opposition could be offered. I objected to this, because I could not\n      believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did\n      not affect his superstitious prejudices) would suffer himself to be so\n      easily entrapped. The very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was\n      sufficient proof that he was upon the alert,—it not being usual\n      except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a\n      watch on deck when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind. As I address\n      myself principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to\n      sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such\n      circumstances. Lying-to, or, in sea-parlance, “laying-to,” is a measure\n      resorted to for various purposes, and effected in various manners. In\n      moderate weather it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the\n      vessel to a stand-still, to wait for another vessel or any similar object.\n      If the vessel which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually\n      accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as to let the\n      wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But we are now speaking\n      of lying-to in a gale of wind. This is done when the wind is ahead, and\n      too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of capsizing; and\n      sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel\n      to be put before it. If a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a\n      very heavy sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water\n      over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward.\n      This manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such case, unless through\n      necessity. When the vessel is in a leaky condition she is often put before\n      the wind even in the heaviest seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure\n      to be greatly opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the\n      case when scudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel,\n      either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the\n      sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or\n      when, through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main\n      object cannot be effected.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners, according to\n      their peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under a foresail, and this,\n      I believe, is the sail most usually employed. Large square-rigged vessels\n      have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails. But the jib is\n      occasionally employed by itself,—sometimes the jib and foresail, or\n      a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are made\n      use of. Foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose better\n      than any other species of sail. The Grampus was generally laid-to under a\n      close-reefed foresail.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the wind just so\n      nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft, that\n      is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. This being done, the bows\n      point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues,\n      and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves. In this\n      situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without\n      shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention being\n      requisite on the part of the crew. The helm is usually lashed down, but\n      this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it makes\n      when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when lying-to.\n      Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast, for\n      the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the\n      helm to play. As long as the sail holds, a well modelled vessel will\n      maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and\n      reason. If the violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into\n      pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under\n      ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. The vessel falls\n      off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea, is completely at its\n      mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her quietly before the\n      wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be set. Some vessels will\n      lie-to under no sail whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But to return from this digression. It had never been customary with the\n      mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale of wind, and the\n      fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing\n      axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the\n      watch to be taken by surprise in the manner Peters had suggested.\n      Something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as\n      practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once\n      entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the earliest\n      occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon the\n      breaking of the gale.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove, under any\n      pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the\n      stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means\n      of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled\n      and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the\n      superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will be\n      remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died during the\n      morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking\n      some spirits and water. Peters had expressed to us his opinion that this\n      man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so\n      he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be prevailed\n      upon to explain to us—this wayward refusal being only in keeping\n      with other points of his singular character. But whether or not he had any\n      better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves, we were\n      easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act\n      accordingly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions; and\n      the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid\n      and loathsome spectacles I ever remember to have seen. The stomach was\n      swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under\n      water for many weeks. The hands were in the same condition, while the face\n      was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where relieved\n      by two or three glaring red blotches like those occasioned by the\n      erysipelas: one of these blotches extended diagonally across the face,\n      completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red velvet. In this\n      disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon\n      to be thrown overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now\n      saw it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for his\n      crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew\n      the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial.\n      Having given these directions, he went below, as if to avoid any further\n      sight of his victim. While preparations were making to obey his orders,\n      the gale came on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the\n      present. The corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard\n      scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which I speak, floundering\n      about with the furious lurches of the brig.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as speedily\n      as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated, was\n      immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to be stationed more as a\n      watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose. The fate of this\n      villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for Peters,\n      approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized\n      him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him\n      over the bulwarks. He then called to us, and we came up. Our first\n      precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves,\n      and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was impossible\n      to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and violent seas broke\n      over the vessel at every plunge forward. It was indispensable, too, that\n      we should be quick in our operations, for every minute we expected the\n      mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be\n      taking in water very fast. After searching about for some time, we could\n      find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles, one of\n      which Augustus took, and I the other. Having secured these, we stripped\n      off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard. Peters and\n      myself then went below, leaving Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took\n      his station just where Allen had been placed, and with his back to the\n      cabin companionway, so that, if any of the mate's gang should come up, he\n      might suppose it was the watch.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to represent\n      the corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from the body aided us\n      very much, for it was of singular form and character, and easily\n      recognizable—a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other\n      clothing. It was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running\n      across. Having put this on, I proceeded to equip myself with a false\n      stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse.\n      This was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. I then\n      gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen\n      mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered\n      themselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over with\n      white chalk, and afterward blotching it with blood, which he took from a\n      cut in his finger. The streak across the eye was not forgotten and\n      presented a most shocking appearance.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.9\"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>\n<p>\n      As I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in the\n      cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I was so\n      impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the\n      recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus representing, that I\n      was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon resolution to\n      go on with my part. It was necessary, however, to act with decision, and\n      Peters and myself went upon deck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks, the\n      three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It was only partially\n      closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed\n      to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so\n      as to interfere with the shutting. We found no difficulty in getting a\n      full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges\n      were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had\n      not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were evidently on the\n      alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at the foot of the\n      companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The rest were seated on\n      several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the\n      floor. They were engaged in earnest conversation; and although they had\n      been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers\n      which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated as usual. All had\n      knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in\n      a berth close at hand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up\n      our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate,\n      except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should\n      attack them, by means of the apparition of Rogers. They were discussing\n      their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that\n      they would unite with the crew of a schooner <i>Hornet</i>, and, if\n      possible, get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to\n      some attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made\n      out by either of us.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a low\n      voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more loudly,\n      that “he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain’s\n      brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them were\n      overboard the better.” To this no answer was made, but we could easily\n      perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and more\n      particularly by Jones. At this period I was excessively agitated, the more\n      so as I could see that neither Augustus nor Peters could determine how to\n      act. I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as possible,\n      and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging, and\n      the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us from hearing what was\n      said, except during momentary lulls. In one of these, we all distinctly\n      heard the mate tell one of the men to “go forward, have an eye upon them,\n      for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig.” It was well for us\n      that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to\n      prevent this order from being carried into instant execution. The cook got\n      up from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I\n      thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against one of the\n      larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and creating a good deal of\n      other confusion. Luckily, neither of our party was thrown from his\n      position, and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle,\n      and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his\n      appearance, or rather before he put his head out of the companion-hatch,\n      for he did not come on deck. From this station he could not notice the\n      absence of Allen, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating\n      the orders of the mate. Peters cried out, “Ay, ay,” in a disguised voice,\n      and the cook immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that\n      all was not right.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin, Peters\n      closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it. The mate\n      received them with feigned cordiality, and told Augustus that, since he\n      had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his quarters in the\n      cabin and be one of them for the future. He then poured him out a tumbler\n      half full of rum, and made him drink it. All this I saw and heard, for I\n      followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up\n      my old point of observation. I had brought with me the two pump-handles,\n      one of which I secured near the companion-way, to be ready for use when\n      required.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all\n      that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of\n      descending among the mutineers when Peters should make a signal to me, as\n      agreed upon. Presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the\n      bloody deeds of the mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the\n      thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. I\n      could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see the effects\n      of the conversation in the countenances of those present. The mate was\n      evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one mentioned the\n      terrific appearance of Rogers’ corpse, I thought he was upon the point of\n      swooning. Peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to\n      have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to\n      see it floundering about in the scuppers. At this the villain absolutely\n      gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his companions,\n      as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task. No one, however,\n      stirred, and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to\n      the highest pitch of nervous excitement. Peters now made me the signal. I\n      immediately threw open the door of the companion-way, and, descending,\n      without uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be\n      wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration.\n      Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in the mind of the\n      spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before\n      his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he is the victim of\n      chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the old\n      world of shadows. It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt\n      have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that the\n      appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is to be\n      attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most suffering has\n      been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative horror, lest the\n      apparition might possibly be real, than to an unwavering belief in its\n      reality. But, in the present instance, it will be seen immediately, that\n      in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis\n      upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a\n      revivification of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image.\n      The isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility on\n      account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of deception\n      within such narrow and definite limits, that they must have thought\n      themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance. They had now been at\n      sea twenty-four days, without holding more than a speaking communication\n      with any vessel whatever. The whole of the crew, too—at least all\n      whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board—were\n      assembled in the cabin, with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his\n      gigantic stature (he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in\n      their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to\n      enter their minds even for an instant. Add to these considerations the\n      awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought\n      about by Peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual\n      corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the\n      excellence of the imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering\n      light in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging\n      violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and\n      there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than\n      the entire effect which we had anticipated. The mate sprang up from the\n      mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell\n      back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward like\n      a log by a heavy roll of the brig. Of the remaining seven, there were but\n      three who had at first any degree of presence of mind. The four others sat\n      for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable objects of\n      horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. The only opposition we\n      experienced at all was from the cook, John Hunt, and Richard Parker; but\n      they made but a feeble and irresolute defence. The two former were shot\n      instantly by Peters, and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the\n      pump-handle which I had brought with me. In the meantime, Augustus seized\n      one of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer Wilson\n      through the breast. There were now but three remaining; but by this time\n      they had become aroused from their lethargy, and perhaps began to see that\n      a deception had been practised upon them, for they fought with great\n      resolution and fury, and, but for the immense muscular strength of Peters,\n      might have ultimately got the better of us. These three men were—Jones,\n      Greely, and Absolom Hicks. Jones had thrown Augustus to the floor, stabbed\n      him in several places along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon\n      dispatched him (as neither Peters nor myself could immediately get rid of\n      our own antagonists), had it not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon\n      whose assistance we, surely, had never depended. This friend was no other\n      than Tiger. With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most\n      critical moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones, pinned him\n      to the floor in an instant. My friend, however, was now too much injured\n      to render us any aid whatever, and I was so encumbered with my disguise\n      that I could do but little. The dog would not leave his hold upon the\n      throat of Jones—Peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for\n      the two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them\n      sooner, had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and\n      the tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to get hold\n      of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With this he beat\n      out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at\n      me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact\n      with Hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of sheer strength,\n      strangled him instantaneously. Thus, in far less time than I have taken to\n      tell it, we found ourselves masters of the brig.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard Parker.\n      This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with a blow from the\n      pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He now lay motionless by\n      the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon Peters touching him with\n      his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. His head was only slightly\n      cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned\n      by the blow. He now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands\n      behind his back. The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon\n      examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream\n      from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth\n      of the animal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was still\n      blowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more than usual,\n      and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a\n      view of easing her in some measure. At almost every roll to leeward she\n      shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin during\n      our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when I\n      descended. The entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away,\n      as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. The\n      creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it was\n      nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the afterhold, the heel of\n      this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible practice,\n      occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in\n      imminent danger of working from its step. But, to crown all our\n      difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of\n      water.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work\n      immediately at the pumps—Parker, of course, being set at liberty to\n      assist us in the labour. Augustus’s arm was bound up as well as we could\n      effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much. However, we\n      found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by\n      having one pump constantly going. As there were only four of us, this was\n      severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked\n      anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away\n      the mainmast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and,\n      when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least,\n      nor were there any signs of its abating. We now dragged the bodies on deck\n      and threw them overboard. Our next care was to get rid of the mainmast.\n      The necessary preparations having been made, Peters cut away at the mast\n      (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays\n      and lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was given\n      to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the whole mass of wood\n      and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig, and without doing any\n      material injury. We now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much\n      as before, but our situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in\n      spite of the utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the\n      aid of both pumps. The little assistance which Augustus could render us\n      was not really of any importance. To add to our distress, a heavy sea,\n      striking the brig to the windward, threw her off several points from the\n      wind, and, before she could regain her position, another broke completely\n      over her, and hurled her full upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted\n      in a mass to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at\n      random for some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save\n      us from capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but the\n      ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that\n      it was useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not\n      have done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with the\n      excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible\n      manner.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Contrary to Parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast,\n      and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the position\n      in which we lay. In going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit,\n      and left us a complete hulk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat, which\n      had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board.\n      But we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast having\n      gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had been\n      steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in five\n      minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern, the longboat and starboard\n      bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. It was,\n      indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s abating,\n      but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few\n      minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four in the afternoon it was\n      utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and, as\n      the night closed in upon us, I had not a shadow of hope that the vessel\n      would hold together until morning.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to the\n      orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it away\n      lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water, against\n      which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be\n      occasioned by going ashore. We had all calculated that the rudder would\n      hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged as I\n      have never seen one rigged either before or since. Down its main timber\n      there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner\n      down the stern-post. Through these hooks there extended a very thick\n      wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the stern-post and\n      swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous force of the sea which tore it\n      off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in the stern-post, which\n      ran entirely through it, being clinched on the inside, were drawn every\n      one of them completely out of the solid wood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock, when\n      one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right on\n      board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the\n      hatchways, and filling every inch of the vessel with water.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.10\"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>\n<p>\n      Luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to\n      the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the deck\n      as possible. This precaution alone saved us from destruction. As it was,\n      we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which\n      tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly\n      exhausted. As soon as I could recover breath, I called aloud to my\n      companions. Augustus alone replied, saying: “It is all over with us, and\n      may God have mercy upon our souls!” By-and-by both the others were enabled\n      to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still hope;\n      it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the brig could go\n      down, and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the\n      morning. These words inspired me with new life; for, strange as it may\n      seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty\n      oil-casks would not sink, I had been hitherto so confused in mind as to\n      have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the danger which I had\n      for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. As\n      hope revived within me, I made use of every opportunity to strengthen the\n      lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass, and in this\n      occupation I soon discovered that my companions were also busy. The night\n      was as dark as it could possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and\n      confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. Our\n      deck lay level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering\n      ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. It is not\n      too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the water more than\n      one second in three. Although we lay close together, no one of us could\n      see the other, or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we\n      were so tempestuously hurled about. At intervals we called one to the\n      other, thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and\n      encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The feeble\n      condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and\n      as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been\n      impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness, we\n      were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard—yet\n      to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question. Fortunately,\n      his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the\n      upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered\n      windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly broken in\n      their violence. In any other situation than this (into which he had been\n      accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot) he\n      must inevitably have perished before morning. Owing to the brig’s lying so\n      much along, we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would\n      have been the case. The heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard,\n      about one half of the deck being constantly under water. The seas,\n      therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the vessel’s\n      side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while\n      those which came from larboard being what are called back-water seas, and\n      obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture, had not\n      sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us\n      more fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was a mere log,\n      rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the increase,\n      if any thing, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there appeared to\n      us no earthly prospect of deliverance. For several hours we held on in\n      silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way,\n      that the remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of\n      the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and above us,\n      would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned\n      before it could regain the surface. By the mercy of God, however, we were\n      preserved from these imminent dangers, and about midday were cheered by\n      the light of the blessed sun. Shortly afterward we could perceive a\n      sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time\n      since the latter part of the evening before, Augustus spoke, asking\n      Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was any possibility of\n      our being saved. As no reply was at first made to this question, we all\n      concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay; but presently, to\n      our great joy, he spoke, although very feebly, saying that he was in great\n      pain, being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach,\n      that he must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was\n      impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. This occasioned us\n      great distress, as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any\n      manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did. We exhorted him\n      to bear his sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first\n      opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that it\n      would soon be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could\n      help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we\n      concluded that he had perished.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more than\n      one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes,\n      and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a severe\n      gale. I had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and now called\n      to Augustus. He replied, although very feebly, so that I could not\n      distinguish what he said. I then spoke to Peters and to Parker, neither of\n      whom returned any answer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial insensibility,\n      during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as\n      green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls,\n      troops of cavalry, and other phantasies. I now remember that, in all which\n      passed before my mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus, I never\n      fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing\n      of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people on\n      horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving objects,\n      presented themselves in endless succession. When I recovered from this\n      state, the sun was, as near as I could guess, an hour high. I had the\n      greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances\n      connected with my situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced\n      that I was still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body\n      of Parker was that of Tiger.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the wind blew\n      no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively calm;\n      so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. My left arm had\n      broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the elbow; my right\n      was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the\n      pressure of the rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. I was\n      also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had\n      been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. Looking round upon my\n      companions, I saw that Peters still lived, although a thick line was\n      pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being\n      cut nearly in two; as I stirred, he made a feeble motion to me with his\n      hand, pointing to the rope. Augustus gave no indication of life whatever,\n      and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke\n      to me when he saw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength\n      to release him from his situation, saying that if I would summon up what\n      spirits I could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives;\n      but that otherwise we must all perish. I told him to take courage, and I\n      would endeavor to free him. Feeling in my pantaloons’ pocket, I got hold\n      of my penknife, and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length\n      succeeded in opening it. I then, with my left hand, managed to free my\n      right from its fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held\n      me. Upon attempting, however, to move from my position, I found that my\n      legs failed me altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I\n      move my right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he\n      advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass with\n      my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate. Doing this,\n      the numbness presently began to die away so that I could move first one of\n      my legs, and then the other, and, shortly afterward I regained the partial\n      use of my right arm. I now crawled with great caution toward Parker,\n      without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about him,\n      when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use of his limbs.\n      We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from Peters. It had cut a\n      deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons, and through two\n      shirts, and made its way into his groin, from which the blood flowed out\n      copiously as we removed the cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however,\n      than he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief—being able to\n      move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself—this was no\n      doubt owing to the discharge of blood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs of\n      life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely swooned\n      from the loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm\n      having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which held him to the\n      windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death. Having\n      relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood\n      about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his\n      head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied ourselves in\n      chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came to himself, although it\n      was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognizing any of\n      us, or had sufficient strength to speak. By the time we had thus got clear\n      of our lashings it was quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we\n      were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in\n      which event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we\n      were. By good fortune it continued very moderate during the night, the sea\n      subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes of ultimate\n      preservation. A gentle breeze still blew from the N. W., but the weather\n      was not at all cold. Augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a\n      manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the\n      vessel, as he was still too weak to hold on at all. For ourselves there\n      was no such necessity. We sat close together, supporting each other with\n      the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods of\n      escape from our frightful situation. We derived much comfort from taking\n      off our clothes and wringing the water from them. When we put them on\n      after this, they felt remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to\n      invigorate us in no little degree. We helped Augustus off with his, and\n      wrung them for him, when he experienced the same comfort.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and when we\n      looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk\n      within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less\n      dreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured, however, to console ourselves\n      with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel and encouraged\n      each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still\n      continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from the\n      N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which we could\n      not determine, the brig did not lie so much along as she had done before,\n      the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with freedom. We\n      had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food\n      or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an\n      attempt to get up something from below. As the brig was completely full of\n      water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little expectation\n      of being able to obtain anything. We made a kind of drag by driving some\n      nails which we broke out from the remains of the companion-hatch into two\n      pieces of wood. Tying these across each other, and fastening them to the\n      end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro,\n      in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might\n      be of use to us for food, or which might at least render us assistance in\n      getting it. We spent the greater part of the morning in this labour\n      without effect, fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes, which were\n      readily caught by the nails. Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy\n      that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the brink\n      of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body,\n      and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin.\n      This proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could\n      inspire. He proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the\n      exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened\n      around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner\n      that there was no possibility of its slipping. The undertaking was one of\n      great difficulty and danger; for, as we could hardly expect to find much,\n      if any, provision in the cabin itself, it was necessary that the diver,\n      after letting himself down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed\n      under water a distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the\n      storeroom, and return, without drawing breath.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going down the\n      companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He then plunged in,\n      head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to make\n      his way to the storeroom. In this first attempt, however, he was\n      altogether unsuccessful. In less than half a minute after his going down\n      we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he\n      desired to be drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so\n      incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had brought\n      nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little\n      way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it\n      necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the\n      deck. Upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full\n      fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long\n      under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his\n      safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the\n      last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without our\n      feeling it. This was probably owing to a portion of it having become\n      entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This balustrade\n      was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if\n      possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means of getting\n      it away except by main force, we all descended into the water as far as we\n      could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our united\n      strength, succeeded in breaking it down.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it now\n      became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid\n      of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep to the\n      floor of the cabin while making his search. For a long time we looked\n      about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but at\n      length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains so\n      loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. Having\n      fastened this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his fourth\n      descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way to the\n      door of the steward’s room. To his inexpressible grief, however, he found\n      it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance, as,\n      with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water not more, at the\n      utmost extent, than a single minute. Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed,\n      and neither Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as\n      we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the\n      slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape. But this\n      weakness was not of long duration. Throwing ourselves on our knees to God,\n      we implored His aid in the many dangers which beset us; and arose with\n      renewed hope and vigor to think what could yet be done by mortal means\n      toward accomplishing our deliverance.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.11\"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>\n<p>\n      Shortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look upon as\n      more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the\n      extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the\n      thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded\n      with events of the most startling and, in many cases, of the most\n      unconceived and unconceivable character. We were lying on the deck near\n      the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way into\n      the storeroom, when, looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting myself, I\n      perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips\n      were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner. Greatly\n      alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I was beginning to\n      think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I took notice of his eyes,\n      which were glaring apparently at some object behind me. I turned my head,\n      and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every\n      particle of my frame, when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us,\n      and not more than a couple of miles off. I sprung to my feet as if a\n      musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out my\n      arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner, motionless, and\n      unable to articulate a syllable. Peters and Parker were equally affected,\n      although in different ways. The former danced about the deck like a\n      madman, uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with\n      howls and imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued\n      for many minutes weeping like a child.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch build, and\n      painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. She had evidently seen a\n      good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered much in the\n      gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her foretopmast was\n      gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. When we first saw her, she was,\n      as I have already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down\n      upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us chiefly was,\n      that she had no other sails set than her foremast and mainsail, with a\n      flying jib—of course she came down but slowly, and our impatience\n      amounted nearly to phrensy. The awkward manner in which she steered, too,\n      was remarked by all of us, even excited as we were. She yawed about so\n      considerably, that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see\n      us, or imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board,\n      she was about to tack and make off in another direction. Upon each of\n      these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices, when the\n      stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention, and again hold\n      on toward us—this singular conduct being repeated two or three\n      times, so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for\n      it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter\n      of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by their dress we took to\n      be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on some old sails near the\n      forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with great\n      curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit. This last\n      was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. He seemed by his manner\n      to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful\n      although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display a set of\n      the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel drew nearer, we saw a red\n      flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water; but of this\n      he took little or no notice, continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations.\n      I relate these things and circumstances minutely, and I relate them, it\n      must be understood, precisely as they <i>appeared</i>to us.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and—I\n      cannot speak calmly of this event—our hearts leaped up wildly within\n      us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to God\n      for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so\n      palpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over the\n      ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a smell, a\n      stench, such as the whole world has no name for—no conception of—hellish—utterly\n      suffocating—insufferable, inconceivable. I gasped for breath, and\n      turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than marble. But\n      we had now no time left for question or surmise—the brig was within\n      fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to run under our\n      counter, that we might board her without putting out a boat. We rushed\n      aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from\n      the course she had been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the\n      distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. Shall I\n      ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? Twenty-five or thirty\n      human bodies, among whom were several females, lay scattered about between\n      the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of\n      putrefaction. We plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel!\n      Yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help! Yes, long and loudly\n      did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting\n      images would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them, would\n      receive us among their goodly company! We were raving with horror and\n      despair—thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous\n      disappointment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by\n      something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling\n      the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled\n      and deceived. At this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the\n      forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin of the\n      sound. We saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and\n      still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so\n      that we could not behold it. His arms were extended over the rail, and the\n      palms of his hands fell outward. His knees were lodged upon a stout rope,\n      tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a\n      cathead. On his back, from which a portion of the shirt had been torn,\n      leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull, busily gorging itself with the\n      horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried, and its white plumage\n      spattered all over with blood. As the brig moved farther round so as to\n      bring us close in view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out\n      its crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if stupefied,\n      arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting, and, flying\n      directly above our deck, hovered there a while with a portion of clotted\n      and liver-like substance in its beak. The horrid morsel dropped at length\n      with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of Parker. May God forgive\n      me, but now, for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought,\n      a thought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step toward\n      the ensanguined spot. I looked upward, and the eyes of Augustus met my own\n      with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to\n      my senses. I sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the\n      frightful thing into the sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope,\n      had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous\n      bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the\n      belief of its being alive. As the gull relieved it of its weight, it swung\n      round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully discovered.\n      Never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! The eyes were gone,\n      and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked.\n      This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! this the—but\n      I forbear. The brig, as I have already told, passed under our stern, and\n      made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With her and with her\n      terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy.\n      Deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means of\n      boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature\n      of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active\n      faculty of mind and body. We had seen and felt, but we could neither think\n      nor act, until, alas! too late. How much our intellects had been weakened\n      by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when the vessel had\n      proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull,\n      the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by\n      swimming!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the\n      hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. Her build\n      and general appearance, as I have before stated, led us to the belief that\n      she was a Dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained this\n      opinion. We might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed,\n      taken other observations, which would have guided us in making out her\n      character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every\n      thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as\n      were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her company had\n      perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease of the same\n      fearful kind. If such were the case (and I know not what else to imagine),\n      death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them\n      in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct\n      from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences\n      with which mankind are acquainted. It is possible, indeed, that poison,\n      accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought\n      about the disaster, or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of\n      fish, or other marine animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it—but\n      it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will,\n      no doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable\n      mystery.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.12\"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>\n<p>\n      We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy,\n      gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from our\n      sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. The pangs of hunger and\n      thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and considerations.\n      Nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and, securing ourselves\n      as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. In this I\n      succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions, who had\n      not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at\n      getting up provisions from the hull.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever known it,—the\n      weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of sight. We commenced our\n      operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of the forechains;\n      and having fastened both to Peters’ feet, he again made an endeavour to\n      reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be\n      able to force it open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and\n      this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of the\n      chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force the passage with\n      it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than was\n      anticipated. He was quite exhausted with his long stay under water, and it\n      became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his\n      place. For this service Parker immediately volunteered; but, after making\n      three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in\n      getting near the door. The condition of Augustus’s wounded arm rendered it\n      useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be unable to force the\n      room open should he reach it, and it accordingly now devolved upon me to\n      exert myself for our common deliverance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found, upon\n      plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down. I\n      determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than merely\n      to recover the other chain. In groping along the floor of the passage for\n      this, I felt a hard substance, which I immediately grasped, not having\n      time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending instantly to\n      the surface. The prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived\n      when I say that it was found to be full of port wine. Giving thanks to God\n      for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew the cork with\n      my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt the most indescribable\n      comfort from the warmth, strength, and spirits with which it inspired us.\n      We then carefully recorked the bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief,\n      swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting\n      broken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again descended,\n      and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly came up. I then\n      fastened it on and went down for the third time, when I became fully\n      satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable me\n      to force open the door of the storeroom. I therefore returned in despair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could perceive\n      in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to\n      perish. The wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium,\n      which, perhaps, I had been prevented from feeling by the immersion I had\n      undergone since drinking it. They talked incoherently, and about matters\n      unconnected with our condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions\n      about Nantucket. Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious\n      air, and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of\n      fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore. Parker\n      appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at random into the\n      cabin, and bring up any article which might come to hand. To this I\n      consented, and, in the first attempt, after staying under a full minute,\n      brought up a small leather trunk belonging to Captain Barnard. This was\n      immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to\n      eat or drink. We found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two\n      linen shirts. I now went down again, and returned without any success. As\n      my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up,\n      saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to\n      drink the remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the\n      endeavour to replace it before I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the\n      heartlessness of their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The other\n      two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never again\n      to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of countenance was\n      absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent that the stimulus, in the\n      empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and violent effect, and\n      that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. With great difficulty I\n      prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy\n      slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections, to\n      be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. No prospect offered\n      itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the best, by\n      being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up, for in our\n      present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through\n      another.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly insupportable, and I\n      felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it. With\n      my knife I cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and endeavoured\n      to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel,\n      although I fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was\n      obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. Toward night\n      my companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of\n      weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now\n      evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the most\n      lamentable cries for water. Their condition affected me in the most lively\n      degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of\n      circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine, and\n      consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing\n      sensations. Their conduct, however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm;\n      for it was evident that, unless some favourable change took place, they\n      could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety. I had\n      not yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from below; but\n      the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was\n      sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope\n      while I went down. Parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of\n      his senses than the others, and I endeavoured, by every means in my power,\n      to rouse him. Thinking that a plunge in the sea-water might have a\n      beneficial effect, I contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his\n      body, and then, leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite\n      passive all the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. I had\n      good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment; for\n      he appeared much revived and invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me,\n      in a rational manner, why I had so served him. Having explained my object,\n      he expressed himself indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better\n      from the immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. We\n      then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which we\n      immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from the shock.\n      This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some\n      medical work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the\n      patient was suffering from <i>mania a potu</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope,\n      I again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it was now\n      quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the\n      hulk somewhat unsteady. In the course of these attempts I succeeded in\n      bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but\n      nothing which could serve us for food. I continued my efforts, after\n      getting these articles, until I was completely exhausted, but brought up\n      nothing else. During the night Parker and Peters occupied themselves by\n      turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we now gave up this\n      attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense\n      mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. The morning of\n      the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon\n      for relief, but to no purpose. The sea was still smooth, with only a long\n      swell from the northward, as on yesterday. This was the sixth day since we\n      had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port\n      wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while\n      longer unless something could be obtained. I never saw before, nor wish to\n      see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as Peters and Augustus. Had I\n      met them on shore in their present condition I should not have had the\n      slightest suspicion that I had ever beheld them. Their countenances were\n      totally changed in character, so that I could not bring myself to believe\n      them really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a few\n      days before. Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble that he could\n      not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far gone as the other two.\n      He suffered with great patience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to\n      inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise. For myself, although\n      at the commencement of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all\n      times of a delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being\n      much less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a\n      surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect,\n      and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood, generally\n      simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most\n      absurd platitudes. At intervals, however, they would appear to revive\n      suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their\n      condition, when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of\n      vigour, and speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner\n      altogether rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is\n      possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the same\n      opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I may have\n      unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as\n      themselves—this is a matter which cannot be determined.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter, and\n      it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain him from plunging into\n      the sea with the view of swimming toward it. Peters and Augustus took\n      little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody\n      contemplation. Upon looking in the direction pointed out, I could not\n      perceive the faintest appearance of the shore—indeed, I was too well\n      aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature.\n      It was a long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker of his\n      mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a child, with\n      loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when becoming exhausted, he\n      fell asleep.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow\n      portions of the leather. I advised them to chew it and spit it out; but\n      they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice. I\n      continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from so\n      doing; my chief distress was for water, and I was only prevented from\n      taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences\n      which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with\n      ourselves.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail to the\n      eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a large ship, and\n      was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles\n      distant. None of my companions had as yet discovered her, and I forbore to\n      tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed of\n      relief. At length upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she was\n      heading immediately for us, with her light sails filled. I could now\n      contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers. They\n      immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most extravagant\n      demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping,\n      stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by\n      turns. I was so affected by their conduct, as well as by what I considered\n      a sure prospect of deliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in\n      with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and\n      ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands, shouting, and\n      other similar acts, until I was suddenly called to my recollection, and\n      once more to the extreme human misery and despair, by perceiving the ship\n      all at once with her stern fully presented toward us, and steering in a\n      direction nearly opposite to that in which I had at first perceived her.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to believe that\n      this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. They replied\n      to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were\n      not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. The conduct of Augustus\n      most sensibly affected me. In spite of all I could say or do to the\n      contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and\n      in making preparations to go on board of her. Some seaweed floating by the\n      brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat, and endeavoured to throw\n      himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner,\n      when I forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship\n      until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with a\n      light breeze springing up. As soon as she was entirely gone, Parker turned\n      suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made me\n      shudder. There was about him an air of self-possession which I had not\n      noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me\n      what he would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die\n      to preserve the existence of the others.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.13\"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>\n<p>\n      I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to\n      this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to suffer\n      death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a\n      course. Nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present\n      intensity of hunger under which I laboured. The proposition had not been\n      heard by either Peters or Augustus. I therefore took Parker aside; and\n      mentally praying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible\n      purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long time, and in\n      the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of every thing which\n      he held sacred, and urging him by every species of argument which the\n      extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea, and not to mention\n      it to either of the other two.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments,\n      and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as I\n      desired. But when I had ceased speaking, he said that he knew very well\n      all I had said was true, and that to resort to such a course was the most\n      horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man; but that he\n      had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained; that it was\n      unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible,\n      and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved; adding that I\n      might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose, his\n      mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the\n      appearance of the ship, and that only her heaving in sight had prevented\n      him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design,\n      at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might come to our\n      relief; again reiterating every argument I could devise, and which I\n      thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature. He said, in\n      reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment, that he\n      could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore\n      in another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself at\n      least.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a mild\n      tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that he must be\n      aware I had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my\n      health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than his\n      own, or than that either of Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was in a\n      condition to have my own way by force if I found it necessary; and that if\n      he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and\n      cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the sea. Upon\n      this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a knife, made\n      several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach; an atrocity which\n      his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing. In the\n      meantime, being roused to a high pitch of anger, I forced him to the\n      vessel’s side, with the full intention of throwing him overboard. He was\n      saved from his fate, however, by the interference of Peters, who now\n      approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance. This\n      Parker told before I could find means in any manner to prevent him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had\n      anticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long secretly\n      entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been merely the first\n      to broach, joined with him in his design and insisted upon its immediately\n      being carried into effect. I had calculated that one at least of the two\n      former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to\n      side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a\n      purpose, and, with the aid of either one of them, I had no fear of being\n      able to prevent its accomplishment. Being disappointed in this\n      expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend to my own\n      safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by\n      men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair\n      play in the tragedy that I knew would speedily be enacted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely requesting\n      a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had gathered around\n      us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was possible that the\n      ship we had seen might be again in sight. After great difficulty I\n      obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated\n      (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired,\n      when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling scene which\n      ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events have\n      been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and whose\n      stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my existence. Let\n      me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature\n      of the events to be spoken of will permit. The only method we could devise\n      for the terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was that\n      of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood were made to answer our\n      purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the holder. I retired to one\n      end of the hulk, while my poor companions silently took up their station\n      in the other with their backs turned toward me. The bitterest anxiety\n      which I endured at any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied\n      myself in the arrangement of the lots. There are few conditions into which\n      man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the\n      preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily increasing with the\n      frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held. But now that\n      the silent, definite, and stern nature of the business in which I was\n      engaged (so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the\n      gradually approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few\n      chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths—a death for\n      the most appalling of purposes—every particle of that energy which\n      had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind, leaving\n      me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror. I could not, at\n      first, even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the\n      small splinters of wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and\n      my knees knocking violently against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a\n      thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful\n      speculation. I thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and\n      entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon\n      them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by\n      lot useless—in short, of every thing but of going through with the\n      matter I had in hand. At last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile\n      conduct, I was recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me\n      to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring. Even\n      then I could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot, but\n      thought over every species of finesse by which I could trick some one of\n      my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that\n      whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for\n      the preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for this apparent\n      heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my\n      own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost bursting\n      from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the forecastle, where my\n      companions were awaiting me. I held out my hand with the splinters, and\n      Peters immediately drew. He was free—his, at least, was not the\n      shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape. I summoned\n      up all my strength, and passed the lots to Augustus. He also drew\n      immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether I should live or die,\n      the chances were no more than precisely even. At this moment all the\n      fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward my poor\n      fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most diabolical hatred. But\n      the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive shudder and\n      closed eyes, I held out the two remaining splinters toward him. It was\n      fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw, during which\n      period of heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes. Presently one\n      of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. The decision was then\n      over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me. No one spoke,\n      and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter I held.\n      Peters at length took me by the hand, and I forced myself to look up, when\n      I immediately saw by the countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that\n      he it was who had been doomed to suffer. Gasping for breath, I fell\n      senseless to the deck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the\n      tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing\n      it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in the back by\n      Peters, when he fell instantly dead. I must not dwell upon the fearful\n      repast which immediately ensued. Such things may be imagined, but words\n      have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their\n      reality. Let it suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the\n      raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having by\n      common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing them together\n      with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the rest of the body,\n      piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth,\n      eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the month.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or\n      twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which\n      had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale. The\n      quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon; but\n      even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. The\n      weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional fogs and light\n      breezes, most usually from N. to W.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together, gloomily\n      revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through my mind all\n      at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope. I\n      remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, Peters, being in the\n      windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put\n      it, if possible, in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the\n      last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe into\n      the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths. I now thought it\n      possible that, by getting at this axe, we might cut through the deck over\n      the storeroom, and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a feeble\n      shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle. The\n      difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the\n      cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that the\n      whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried away,\n      whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet\n      square, had remained uninjured. I did not hesitate, however, to attempt\n      the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as before, I plunged\n      boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly to the berth, and at the\n      first attempt brought up the axe. It was hailed with the most ecstatic joy\n      and triumph, and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as\n      an omen of our ultimate preservation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled\n      hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns, Augustus’s wounded arm\n      not permitting him to aid us in any degree. As we were still so feeble as\n      to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work but\n      a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many long\n      hours would be necessary to accomplish our task—that is, to cut an\n      opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom.\n      This consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all night\n      by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by\n      daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements as\n      before, he descended, and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar,\n      which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. Having shared these\n      among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let\n      him down again. This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations,\n      returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine. Of the\n      latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience the\n      pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. The ham, except about two\n      pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to be eaten, having been\n      entirely spoiled by the salt water. The sound part was divided among us.\n      Peters and Augustus, not being able to restrain their appetite, swallowed\n      theirs upon the instant; but I was more cautious, and ate but a small\n      portion of mine, dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue. We now\n      rested a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed our\n      attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself going down\n      alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown. During\n      this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four more\n      small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three\n      gallons of excellent Cape Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more\n      delight, a small tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had\n      been taken on board by Captain Barnard, as the <i>Grampus</i> was leaving\n      port, from the schooner <i>Mary Pitts</i>, just returned from a sealing\n      voyage in the Pacific.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent occasion\n      to mention this species of tortoise. It is found principally, as most of\n      my readers may know, in the group of islands called the Gallipagos, which,\n      indeed, derive their name from the animal—the Spanish word Gallipago\n      meaning a fresh-water terrapin. From the peculiarity of their shape and\n      action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. They are\n      frequently found of an enormous size. I have myself seen several which\n      would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although I do not\n      remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than\n      eight hundred. Their appearance is singular, and even disgusting. Their\n      steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies being carried about\n      a foot from the ground. Their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from\n      eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length, and I killed one,\n      where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no\n      less than three feet ten inches. The head has a striking resemblance to\n      that of a serpent. They can exist without food for an almost incredible\n      length of time, instances having been known where they have been thrown\n      into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any\n      kind—being as fat, and, in every respect, in as good order at the\n      expiration of the time as when they were first put in. In one particular\n      these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel\n      of the desert. In a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a\n      constant supply of water. In some instances, upon killing them after a\n      full year’s deprivation of all nourishment, as much as three gallons of\n      perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags. Their food\n      is chiefly wild parsley and celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly\n      pears, upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great\n      quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore\n      wherever the animal itself is discovered. They are excellent and highly\n      nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving the\n      lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery and other\n      pursuits in the Pacific.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was\n      not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds. It\n      was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and\n      having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag. This was\n      indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we returned\n      fervent thanks to God for so seasonable a relief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as\n      its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. It was upon the\n      point of making its escape from Peter’s grasp, and slipping back into the\n      water, when Augustus, throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat,\n      held it up in this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of\n      Peters, and assisted him in lifting it out.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it will be\n      remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. Having done this,\n      we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind of\n      glass, holding not quite half a gill. We then each drank one of these\n      measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as\n      long as it should hold out.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and\n      pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our\n      clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that of\n      the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil repose,\n      after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a small allowance\n      of the wine. Being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during\n      the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well\n      as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. Our tortoise,\n      which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could, we threw on\n      its back, and otherwise carefully fastened.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.14\"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>\n<p>\n      July 24. This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and\n      strength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still\n      placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance\n      from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with\n      great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at the mercy\n      of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world, still the\n      infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so\n      lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we\n      now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil—so strictly\n      comparative is either good or ill.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something\n      from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some lightning,\n      we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we\n      had used before for this purpose. We had no other means of collecting the\n      rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates\n      in the middle of it. The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained\n      through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in this manner, when, a\n      heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to desist, as the\n      hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our\n      feet. We now went forward, and, lashing ourselves securely to the remnant\n      of the windlass as before, awaited the event with far more calmness than\n      could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the\n      circumstances. At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and\n      by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell.\n      Experience having taught us, however, the best method of arranging our\n      lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security, although\n      thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary\n      dread of being washed off. Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to\n      render the water rather grateful than otherwise.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 25. This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze,\n      and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to\n      keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great grief, however, we found\n      that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been\n      washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been\n      fastened. We determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented\n      ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a\n      measure of water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine,\n      finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the\n      distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port. The sea\n      was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up\n      provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no importance to us in\n      our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day, and\n      were immediately washed overboard. We also now observed that the hulk lay\n      more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant without\n      lashing ourselves. On this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable\n      day. At noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt\n      that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and\n      northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. Toward evening\n      we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner\n      in which an enormously large one approached us. At one time, a lurch\n      throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster actually swam in\n      upon us, floundering for some moments just over the companion-hatch, and\n      striking Peters violently with his tail. A heavy sea at length hurled him\n      overboard, much to our relief. In moderate weather we might have easily\n      captured him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 26. This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea not\n      being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom.\n      After a great deal of hard labor during the whole day, we found that\n      nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of\n      the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into\n      the hold. This discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 27. The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the\n      northward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the afternoon, we\n      occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found great relief from thirst,\n      and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this, however, we\n      were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which\n      were seen swimming around the brig during the day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 28. Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so alarmingly\n      that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. Prepared ourselves as\n      well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and\n      two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward,\n      placing them outside the hull below the main-chains. The sea very smooth\n      all day, with little or no wind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 29. A continuance of the same weather. Augustus’s wounded arm began\n      to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of drowsiness and\n      excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could be done for his relief\n      beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives,\n      and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. We did every thing in\n      our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of water.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 30. An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark kept\n      close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made several\n      unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose. Augustus much\n      worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as\n      from the effect of his wounds. He constantly prayed to be relieved from\n      his sufferings, wishing for nothing but death. This evening we ate the\n      last of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could\n      not swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to kill our\n      tortoise in the morning.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      July 31. After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the\n      position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise. He\n      proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good\n      condition,—the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten\n      pounds. With a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible,\n      we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining olive\n      jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in\n      afterward the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put away about\n      three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had\n      consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces\n      of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days. A brisk\n      shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted\n      so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of\n      water. The whole of this, by common consent, was given to Augustus, who\n      now appeared to be in the last extremity. He drank the water from the\n      sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it\n      run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable of holding water,\n      unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy, or the stale\n      water from the jug. Either of these expedients would have been resorted to\n      had the shower lasted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught. His arm\n      was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet were\n      like ice. We expected every moment to see him breathe his last. He was\n      frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a hundred and\n      twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did not weigh more\n      than forty or fifty at the farthest. His eyes were sunk far in his head,\n      being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as\n      to prevent his masticating any food, or even swallowing any liquid,\n      without great difficulty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 1. A continuance of the same calm weather, with an oppressively hot\n      sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being\n      absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We contrived, nevertheless, to\n      swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine; our thirst, however, was\n      but little abated. We found more relief by bathing in the sea, but could\n      not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals, on account\n      of the continual presence of sharks. We now saw clearly that Augustus\n      could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. We could do nothing to\n      relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great. About twelve o’clock\n      he expired in strong convulsions, and without having spoken for several\n      hours. His death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings, and had so\n      great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse\n      during the whole day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper.\n      It was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and\n      throw the body overboard. It was then loathsome beyond expression, and so\n      far decayed that, as Peters attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off\n      in his grasp. As the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side\n      into the water, the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded\n      plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of\n      whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among them, might\n      have been heard at the distance of a mile. We shrunk within ourselves in\n      the extremity of horror at the sound.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 2. The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found us in a\n      state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. The water in the\n      jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass; nothing but\n      frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. We threw it out, and washed\n      the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our\n      bottles of pickled tortoise. Our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and\n      we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add fuel to\n      the flame, and excited us to a high degree of intoxication. We afterward\n      endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater;\n      but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings, so that we\n      never again attempted it. During the whole day we anxiously sought an\n      opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now entirely\n      besieged on all sides with sharks—no doubt the identical monsters\n      who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before, and who were in\n      momentary expectation of another similar feast. This circumstance\n      occasioned us the most bitter regret and filled us with the most\n      depressing and melancholy forebodings. We had experienced indescribable\n      relief in bathing, and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a\n      manner was more than we could bear. Nor, indeed, were we altogether free\n      from the apprehension of immediate danger, for the least slip or false\n      movement would have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious\n      fish, who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to\n      leeward. No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. Even\n      when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters and much wounded,\n      he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were. A cloud came up at\n      dusk, but, to our extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself.\n      It is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this\n      period. We passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through\n      dread of the sharks.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 3. No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and more\n      along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all.\n      Busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we might\n      not lose them in the event of our rolling over. Got out two stout spikes\n      from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to\n      windward within a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far\n      from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. To these spikes we\n      now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former position\n      beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day—no\n      chance of bathing on account of the sharks, which never left us for a\n      moment. Found it impossible to sleep.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 4. A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling\n      over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement.\n      At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to clamber over\n      to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging\n      from the spikes we had driven in for the provision. But we had not\n      calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus; for,\n      presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with\n      it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves\n      hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath the\n      surface, with the huge hull immediately above us.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold upon the\n      rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the vessel, and my\n      strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a struggle for life, and\n      resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die. But here again I was deceived,\n      not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to\n      windward. The whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in\n      rolling partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently\n      than I had been plunged beneath. Upon coming up I found myself about\n      twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. She was lying keel\n      up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in all directions\n      around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools. I could see\n      nothing of Peters. An oil-cask was floating within a few feet of me, and\n      various other articles from the brig were scattered about.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I knew to be\n      in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible, from approaching me,\n      I splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as I swam towards\n      the hulk, creating a body of foam. I have no doubt that to this expedient,\n      simple as it was, I was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all\n      round the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these\n      monsters, that I must have been, and really was, in actual contact with\n      some of them during my progress. By great good fortune, however, I reached\n      the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly weakened by the\n      violent exertion I had used that I should never have been able to get upon\n      it but for the timely assistance of Peters, who, now, to my great joy,\n      made his appearance (having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite\n      side of the hull), and threw me the end of a rope—one of those which\n      had been attached to the spikes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the\n      dreadful imminency of another—that of absolute starvation. Our whole\n      stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in\n      securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining\n      more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children, and\n      neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other. Such weakness\n      can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been similarly\n      situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that\n      our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation\n      and terror to which we had been subjected, that we could not justly be\n      considered, at that period, in the light of rational beings. In subsequent\n      perils, nearly as great, if not greater, I bore up with fortitude against\n      all the evils of my situation, and Peters, it will be seen, evinced a\n      stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike\n      supineness and imbecility—the mental condition made the difference.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the wine and\n      turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more deplorable\n      than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we\n      had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug in which we\n      had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from within two or\n      three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself,\n      thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be excellent and\n      highly nutritious food. Thus, in two important respects, the accident we\n      had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit rather than an injury; it\n      had opened to us a supply of provisions which we could not have exhausted,\n      using it moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our\n      comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in infinitely\n      less danger, than before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the\n      benefits of the change in our condition. That we might be ready to avail\n      ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall we took off\n      our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets—not hoping,\n      of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favorable\n      circumstances, than half a gill at a time. No signs of a cloud appeared\n      during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. At\n      night, Peters obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my intense\n      sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 5. To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast\n      quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven\n      small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. Their shells being\n      quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our thirst\n      far less than the barnacles. Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed,\n      we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four or five\n      hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our\n      thirst. Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more\n      comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 6. This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain, lasting\n      from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now regret the loss of\n      our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of catching\n      the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them. As it was, we\n      contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to\n      become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid\n      trickle into our mouths. In this occupation we passed the entire day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      August 7. Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to\n      the eastward, and <i>evidently coming towards us!</i> We hailed the\n      glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began\n      instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in the\n      air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by\n      hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel could\n      not have been less than fifteen miles distant. However, she still\n      continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present\n      course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In about an\n      hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see the people on her\n      decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail schooner, with a\n      black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently, a full crew. We now\n      became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not\n      observe us, and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as\n      we were—an act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it\n      may appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under circumstances\n      very nearly similar, and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the\n      human species. {*2} In this instance, however, by the mercy of God, we\n      were destined to be most happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of\n      a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward\n      ran up a British flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. In\n      half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin. She proved to be the\n      Jane Guy, of Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage\n      to the South Seas and Pacific.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.15\"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>\n<p>\n      The <i>Jane Guy</i> was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and\n      eighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind, in\n      moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever seen. Her qualities,\n      however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water\n      was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined. For this\n      peculiar service, a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate\n      draught, is desirable—say a vessel of from three hundred to three\n      hundred and fifty tons. She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects\n      of a different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It is\n      absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should have, say\n      ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three long twelves, with\n      brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top. Her anchors\n      and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any\n      other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be numerous and\n      efficient—not less, for such a vessel as I have described, than\n      fifty or sixty able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five,\n      all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether\n      as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted with the\n      difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of\n      considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted a\n      great portion of his life. He was deficient, however, in energy, and,\n      consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely\n      requisite. He was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was\n      invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the South Seas for any\n      cargo which might come most readily to hand. He had on board, as usual in\n      such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws,\n      adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves, rasps,\n      hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread, crockery-ware,\n      calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed the\n      Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west,\n      and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on the twenty-ninth, where\n      she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. On the third of\n      August, she left the Cape Verds and steered southwest, stretching over\n      toward the coast of Brazil, so as to cross the equator between the\n      meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. This is the\n      course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of Good\n      Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. By proceeding thus they avoid\n      the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the\n      coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the shortest track,\n      as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape.\n      It was Captain Guy’s intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen’s\n      Land—I hardly know for what reason. On the day we were picked up the\n      schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees west; so\n      that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to south, <i>not\n      less than five-and-twenty degrees!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed\n      situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which time we continued\n      steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine weather, both\n      Peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late\n      privation and dreadful sufferings, and we began to remember what had\n      passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily\n      awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality.\n      I have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually\n      brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from\n      sorrow to joy—the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the\n      degree of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my own case, I now feel it\n      impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I endured during\n      the days spent upon the hulk. The incidents are remembered, but not the\n      feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence. I\n      only know, that when they did occur, I then thought human nature could\n      sustain nothing more of agony.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater\n      moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more frequently\n      with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction to the\n      spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly found south of the twenty-fifth\n      parallel. On the sixteenth of September, being in the vicinity of the Cape\n      of Good Hope, the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence\n      since leaving Liverpool. In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the\n      south and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators\n      have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage with\n      great fury. They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most\n      dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an\n      occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the\n      gale. A perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward\n      or northeast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that\n      direction, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a\n      violence almost inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is the sure\n      forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper\n      precautions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall,\n      and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had increased very much,\n      and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I had then ever\n      beheld. Every thing had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner\n      laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat,\n      pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest\n      difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another.\n      Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out\n      made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we\n      perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the\n      mast. In two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled\n      on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a\n      clear breach over us as we lay. The blow from the southwest, however,\n      luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good\n      fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. A heavy cross sea\n      gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but toward morning we\n      found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale. Captain\n      Guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward’s Island,\n      in latitude 46 degrees 53’ S., longitude 37 degrees 46’ E. Two days\n      afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island, and presently passed\n      the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42 degrees 59’ S., longitude 48 degrees\n      E. On the eighteenth we made Kerguelen’s or Desolation Island, in the\n      Southern Indian Ocean, and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having\n      four fathoms of water.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the Cape of\n      Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. It was\n      first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a\n      Frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive\n      southern continent carried home information to that effect, which produced\n      much excitement at the time. The government, taking the matter up, sent\n      the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new\n      discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. In\n      1777, Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the principal\n      one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it certainly well\n      deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the navigator might be\n      induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most of the hills, from\n      September to March, are clothed with very brilliant verdure. This\n      deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage,\n      which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species of crumbling\n      moss. Besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the\n      island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen,\n      and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and\n      which has a bitter and acrid taste.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be called\n      lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow. There are several\n      harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most convenient. It is the\n      first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing\n      Cape Francois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape,\n      serves to distinguish the harbour. Its projecting point terminates in a\n      high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. The\n      entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40’ S., longitude 69 degrees 6’ E.\n      Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several\n      small islands, which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds.\n      Proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay, at the\n      head of the harbour. This is a small basin, completely landlocked, into\n      which you can go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to\n      three, hard clay bottom. A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead\n      all the year round without risk. To the westward, at the head of Wasp Bay,\n      is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on Kerguelen’s\n      Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered tribes are discovered in\n      great numbers. Penguins are very plenty, and of these there are four\n      different kinds. The royal penguin, so called from its size and beautiful\n      plumage, is the largest. The upper part of the body is usually gray,\n      sometimes of a lilac tint; the under portion of the purest white\n      imaginable. The head is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet\n      also. The chief beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes\n      of a gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast. The bill is\n      long, and either pink or bright scarlet. These birds walk erect; with a\n      stately carriage. They carry their heads high with their wings drooping\n      like two arms, and, as their tails project from their body in a line with\n      the legs, the resemblance to a human figure is very striking, and would be\n      apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the\n      evening. The royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen’s Land were\n      rather larger than a goose. The other kinds are the macaroni, the jackass,\n      and the rookery penguin. These are much smaller, less beautiful in\n      plumage, and different in other respects.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which may\n      be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port Egmont hens,\n      shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns, sea gulls, Mother\n      Carey’s chickens, Mother Carey’s geese, or the great peterel, and, lastly,\n      the albatross.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is carnivorous.\n      It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel. They are not\n      at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food. In flying they\n      sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water, with the wings\n      expanded, without appearing to move them in the least degree, or make any\n      exertion with them whatever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea birds.\n      It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming on\n      land except for the purpose of breeding. Between this bird and the penguin\n      the most singular friendship exists. Their nests are constructed with\n      great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two species—that\n      of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by\n      the nests of four penguins. Navigators have agreed in calling an\n      assemblage of such encampments a rookery. These rookeries have been often\n      described, but as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions, and\n      as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross,\n      it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and\n      living.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast\n      numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper\n      course to be pursued. At length they proceed to action. A level piece of\n      ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four\n      acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its\n      reach. The spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and\n      that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones. This matter\n      being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated\n      apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either a\n      square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the ground,\n      and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled,\n      and no more—in this particular seeming determined upon preventing\n      the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labor of\n      the encampment. One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with\n      the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear it\n      of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying them\n      outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on the three\n      inland sides. Just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is\n      formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around the encampment—thus\n      serving the purpose of a general promenade.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares\n      exactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow paths, very smooth,\n      and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of\n      the rookery. At each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross\n      is constructed, and a penguin’s nest in the centre of each square—thus\n      every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a\n      like number of penguins. The penguin’s nest consists of a hole in the\n      earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep her\n      single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less simple in her\n      arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter.\n      This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. On its summit she builds her\n      nest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an\n      instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young\n      progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. While the male\n      is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and it is\n      only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad. The eggs are\n      never left uncovered at all—while one bird leaves the nest the other\n      nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered necessary by the\n      thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants making no\n      scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at every good opportunity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are\n      the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to\n      be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and scattering\n      their nests here and there, wherever they can find room, never\n      interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species. The\n      appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly\n      singular. The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with\n      the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller tribes)\n      which are continually hovering over it, either going to the ocean or\n      returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed,\n      some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some marching with the\n      military strut so peculiar to them, around the general promenade ground\n      which encircles the rookery. In short, survey it as we will, nothing can\n      be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these\n      feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit\n      reflection in every well-regulated human intellect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief mate, Mr.\n      Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in the\n      season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young relation\n      of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having some\n      business, whose nature I could not ascertain, to transact in the interior\n      of the island. Captain Guy took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed\n      letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore\n      toward one of the highest peaks in the place. It is probable that his\n      design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he\n      expected to come after him. As soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded\n      (Peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our cruise around the\n      coast, looking for seal. In this business we were occupied about three\n      weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner, not only of\n      Kerguelen’s Land, but of the several small islands in the vicinity. Our\n      labours, however, were not crowned with any important success. We saw a\n      great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest\n      exertions, we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. Sea\n      elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the mainland,\n      but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great difficulty. On the\n      smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal, but did not\n      molest them. We returned to the schooner on the eleventh, where we found\n      Captain Guy and his nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior,\n      representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in\n      the world. They had remained two nights on the island, owing to some\n      misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending\n      a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.16\"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>\n<p>\n      On the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our way to\n      the westward, and leaving Marion’s Island, one of Crozet’s group, on the\n      larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward’s Island, leaving it also on\n      our left, then, steering more to the northward, made, in fifteen days, the\n      islands of Tristan d’Acunha, in latitude 37 degrees 8’ S, longitude 12\n      degrees 8’ W.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular\n      islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was visited afterward\n      by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in 1767. The three islands\n      together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about ten miles,\n      there being fine open passages between. The land in all of them is very\n      high, especially in Tristan d’Acunha, properly so called. This is the\n      largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so\n      elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or\n      ninety miles. A part of the land toward the north rises more than a\n      thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. A tableland at this height\n      extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this tableland\n      arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The lower half of this cone is\n      clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is barren rock,\n      usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow during the greater\n      part of the year. There are no shoals or other dangers about the island,\n      the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep. On the northwestern\n      coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can\n      be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. Plenty of\n      excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod and other fish may\n      be taken with hook and line.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group, is\n      that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is 37 degrees 17’ S.\n      latitude, longitude 12 degrees 24’ W. It is seven or eight miles in\n      circumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous\n      aspect. Its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is sterile,\n      nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude 37\n      degrees 26’ S., longitude 12 degrees 12’ W. Off its southern extremity is\n      a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are seen\n      to the northeast. The ground is irregular and sterile, and a deep valley\n      partially separates it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea lions,\n      sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great variety of\n      oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their vicinity. Owing to the ease\n      with which these various animals were here formerly taken, the group has\n      been much visited since its discovery. The Dutch and French frequented it\n      at a very early period. In 1790, Captain Patten, of the ship Industry, of\n      Philadelphia, made Tristan d’Acunha, where he remained seven months (from\n      August, 1790, to April, 1791) for the purpose of collecting sealskins. In\n      this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred, and says\n      that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in\n      three weeks. Upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception\n      of a few wild goats; the island now abounds with all our most valuable\n      domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent navigators.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I believe it was not long after Captain Patten’s visit that Captain\n      Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the largest of the\n      islands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted onions, potatoes,\n      cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which is\n      now to be met with.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He found there\n      three Americans, who were residing upon the island to prepare sealskins\n      and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan Lambert, and he called\n      himself the sovereign of the country. He had cleared and cultivated about\n      sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to raising the coffee-plant\n      and sugar-cane, with which he had been furnished by the American Minister\n      at Rio Janeiro. This settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in\n      1817 the islands were taken possession of by the British Government, who\n      sent a detachment for that purpose from the Cape of Good Hope. They did\n      not, however, retain them long; but, upon the evacuation of the country as\n      a British possession, two or three English families took up their\n      residence there independently of the Government. On the twenty-fifth of\n      March, 1824, the Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen’s\n      Land, arrived at the place, where they found an Englishman of the name of\n      Glass, formerly a corporal in the British artillery. He claimed to be\n      supreme governor of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men\n      and three women. He gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the\n      climate and of the productiveness of the soil. The population occupied\n      themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with\n      which they traded to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small schooner.\n      At the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his\n      little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons upon\n      Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on Nightingale Island. We\n      had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we\n      required—sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in\n      great variety, and vegetables were abundant. Having come to anchor close\n      in with the large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on\n      board very conveniently. Captain Guy also purchased of Glass five hundred\n      sealskins and some ivory. We remained here a week, during which the\n      prevailing winds were from the northward and westward, and the weather\n      somewhat hazy. On the fifth of November we made sail to the southward and\n      westward, with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of\n      islands called the Auroras, respecting whose existence a great diversity\n      of opinion has existed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762, by the\n      commander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de Oyarvido, in the\n      ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine Company, sailed, as he\n      asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the Spanish corvette Atrevida went\n      with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a\n      paper published by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year\n      1809, the following language is used respecting this expedition: “The\n      corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from the\n      twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all the necessary\n      observations, and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude\n      between these islands and the port of Soledad in the Manillas. The islands\n      are three, they are very nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is\n      rather low, and the other two may be seen at nine leagues’ distance.” The\n      observations made on board the Atrevida give the following results as the\n      precise situation of each island. The most northern is in latitude 52\n      degrees 37’ 24” S., longitude 47 degrees, 43’ 15” W.; the middle one in\n      latitude 53 degrees 2’ 40” S., longitude 47 degrees 55’ 15” W.; and the\n      most southern in latitude 53 degrees 15’ 22” S., longitude 47 degrees 57’\n      15” W.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of the\n      British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the Auroras. He\n      reports that, having made the most diligent search and passed not only\n      immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the Atrevida, but\n      in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he could\n      discover no indication of land. These conflicting statements have induced\n      other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while\n      some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie\n      without finding them, there have been not a few who declare positively\n      that they have seen them; and even been close in with their shores. It was\n      Captain Guy’s intention to make every exertion within his power to settle\n      the question so oddly in dispute. {*3}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable weather,\n      until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on the debated\n      ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15’ S., longitude 47 degrees 58’ W.—that\n      is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the\n      most southern of the group. Not perceiving any sign of land, we continued\n      to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as\n      the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then stood to the north as far as\n      the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to the eastward,\n      and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning and evening, and\n      meridian altitudes of the planets and moon. Having thus gone eastwardly to\n      the meridian of the western coast of Georgia, we kept that meridian until\n      we were in the latitude from which we set out. We then took diagonal\n      courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a\n      lookout constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with the\n      greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the weather was\n      remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze whatsoever. Of course we were\n      thoroughly satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this\n      vicinity at any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present\n      day. Since my return home I find that the same ground was traced over,\n      with equal care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner\n      Henry, and by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp—in both\n      cases with the same result as in our own.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.17\"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>\n<p>\n      It had been Captain Guy’s original intention, after satisfying himself\n      about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of Magellan, and up along\n      the western coast of Patagonia; but information received at Tristan\n      d’Acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of falling in\n      with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees S.,\n      longitude 41 degrees 20’ W. In the event of his not discovering these\n      lands, he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on toward\n      the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made sail in that\n      direction. On the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station\n      indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days in that neighborhood\n      without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned. On the\n      twenty-first, the weather being unusually pleasant, we again made sail to\n      the southward, with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as\n      possible. Before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as\n      well, for the information of those readers who have paid little attention\n      to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give some brief account\n      of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto\n      been made.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct account.\n      In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution, accompanied by\n      Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December he found himself as far\n      as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude 26\n      degrees 57’ E. Here he met with narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten\n      inches thick, and running northwest and southeast. This ice was in large\n      cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great\n      difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook supposed,\n      from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications, that\n      he was in the near vicinity of land. He kept on to the southward, the\n      weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth\n      parallel, in longitude 38 degrees 14’ E. Here he had mild weather, with\n      gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. In\n      January, 1773, the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not\n      succeed in penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees\n      15’ they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice,\n      extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach.\n      This ice was of every variety—and some large floes of it, miles in\n      extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above the\n      water. It being late in the season, and no hope entertained of rounding\n      these obstructions, Captain Cook now reluctantly turned to the northward.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic. In\n      latitude 59 degrees 40’ he met with a strong current setting to the\n      southward. In December, when the vessels were in latitude 67 degrees 31’,\n      longitude 142 degrees 54’ W., the cold was excessive, with heavy gales and\n      fog. Here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the\n      peterel especially. In latitude 70 degrees 23’ some large islands of ice\n      were encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward were\n      observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity of field ice.\n      In latitude 71 degrees 10’, longitude 106 degrees 54’ W., the navigators\n      were stopped, as before, by an immense frozen expanse, which filled the\n      whole area of the southern horizon. The northern edge of this expanse was\n      ragged and broken, so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible,\n      and extending about a mile to the southward. Behind it the frozen surface\n      was comparatively smooth for some distance, until terminated in the\n      extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice mountains, the one towering\n      above the other. Captain Cook concluded that this vast field reached the\n      southern pole or was joined to a continent. Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose\n      great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set\n      on foot a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these\n      regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the Resolution. “We are not\n      surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71 degrees 10’, but we\n      are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106\n      degrees 54’ west longitude. Palmer’s Land lies south of the Shetland,\n      latitude sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward\n      farther than any navigator has yet penetrated. Cook was standing for this\n      land when his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must\n      always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth\n      of January—and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy\n      mountains described was attached to the main body of Palmer’s Land, or to\n      some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by Alexander\n      of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe. In endeavouring\n      to get south, they made no farther than 59 degrees 58’, in longitude 70\n      degrees 15’ W. They here met with strong currents setting eastwardly.\n      Whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. In regard to this voyage, Mr.\n      Reynolds observes that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier\n      in the season, he must have encountered ice—it was March when he\n      reached the latitude specified. The winds, prevailing, as they do, from\n      the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by currents, into\n      that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia, east by Sandwich Land and\n      the South Orkneys, and west by the South Shetland islands.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two very small\n      vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator, and\n      this, too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties. He states that\n      although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the\n      seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be\n      discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees 15’, no\n      fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. It is somewhat\n      remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were seen, and other usual\n      indications of land, and although, south of the Shetlands, unknown coasts\n      were observed from the masthead tending southwardly, Weddell discourages\n      the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the American\n      schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen’s Land with a view of penetrating as\n      far south as possible. On the first of February he found himself in\n      latitude 64 degrees 52’ S., longitude 118 degrees 27’ E. The following\n      passage is extracted from his journal of that date. “The wind soon\n      freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of\n      making to the west; being however convinced that the farther we went south\n      beyond latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended, we\n      steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the Antarctic circle,\n      and were in latitude 69 degrees 15’ E. In this latitude there was no field\n      ice, and very few ice islands in sight.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Under the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry. “The sea was\n      now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen ice\n      islands in sight. At the same time the temperature of the air and water\n      was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found it\n      between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were now in\n      latitude 70 degrees 14’ S., and the temperature of the air was\n      forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. In this situation I found\n      the variation to be 14 degrees 27’ easterly, per azimuth.... I have\n      several times passed within the Antarctic circle, on different meridians,\n      and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and the water,\n      to become more and more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth\n      degree of south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same\n      proportion. While north of this latitude, say between sixty and sixty-five\n      south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the\n      vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands, some of\n      which were from one to two miles in circumference, and more than five\n      hundred feet above the surface of the water.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper instruments,\n      it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell was now obliged to put\n      back, without attempting any further progress to the westward, although an\n      entirely open, sea lay before him. He expresses the opinion that, had not\n      these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have\n      penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the eighty-fifth\n      parallel. I have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at\n      length, that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they\n      were borne out by my own subsequent experience.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,\n      whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the South Seas,\n      accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth of February, being in\n      latitude 66 degrees 30’ S., longitude 47 degrees 31’ E., he descried land,\n      and “clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of\n      mountains running E. S. E.” He remained in this neighbourhood during the\n      whole of the following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer\n      than within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather.\n      Finding it impossible to make further discovery during this season, he\n      returned northward to winter in Van Diemen’s Land.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on the fourth\n      of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude 67 degrees 15’ longitude\n      69 degrees 29’ W. This was soon found to be an island near the headland of\n      the country he had first discovered. On the twenty-first of the month he\n      succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of it in the name\n      of William IV, calling it Adelaide’s Island, in honour of the English\n      queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal Geographical\n      Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that body “that there is a\n      continuous tract of land extending from 47 degrees 30’ E. to 69 degrees\n      29’ W. longitude, running the parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven\n      degrees south latitude.” In respect to this conclusion Mr. Reynolds\n      observes: “In the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the\n      discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such indifference. It was within these\n      limits that Weddel proceeded south on a meridian to the east of Georgia,\n      Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney and Shetland islands.” My own\n      experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of the\n      conclusion arrived at by the society.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a\n      high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained,\n      previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly three hundred degrees of\n      longitude in which the Antarctic circle had not been crossed at all. Of\n      course a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with feelings\n      of most intense interest that I heard Captain Guy express his resolution\n      of pushing boldly to the southward.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.18\"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>\n<p>\n      We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search\n      for Glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all. On the\n      twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63 degrees 23’ S., longitude 41\n      degrees 25’ W. We now saw several large ice islands, and a floe of field\n      ice, not, however, of any great extent. The winds generally blew from the\n      southeast, or the northeast, but were very light. Whenever we had a\n      westerly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain\n      squall. Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the\n      twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 1, 1828.—This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by\n      the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. A strong gale blew,\n      during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of\n      the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all\n      trembled for the consequences. Toward evening, the gale still blowing with\n      fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a\n      press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open\n      water beyond. As we approached this space we took in sail by degrees, and\n      having at length got clear, lay-to under a single reefed foresail.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 2.—We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we found\n      ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10’ S, longitude 42 degrees 20’ W, having\n      crossed the Antarctic circle. Very little ice was to be seen to the\n      southward, although large fields of it lay behind us. This day we rigged\n      some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty\n      gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. We found the current setting\n      to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour. The temperature of the\n      air was now about thirty-three. Here we found the variation to be 14\n      degrees 28’ easterly, per azimuth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 5.—We had still held on to the southward without any very\n      great impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73 degrees\n      15’ E., longitude 42 degrees 10’ W, we were again brought to a stand by an\n      immense expanse of firm ice. We saw, nevertheless, much open water to the\n      southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually.\n      Standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came to\n      a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by\n      sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice\n      islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before. The cold\n      did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently, and now\n      and then hail squalls of great violence. Immense flocks of the albatross\n      flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to northwest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 7.—The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had\n      no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we saw some\n      icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one\n      whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the\n      surface of the ocean. Its girth was probably, at the base, three-quarters\n      of a league, and several streams of water were running from crevices in\n      its sides. We remained in sight of this island two days, and then only\n      lost it in a fog.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 10.—Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man\n      overboard. He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a native of New\n      York, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner. In\n      going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes of\n      ice, never rising again. At noon of this day we were in latitude 78\n      degrees 30’, longitude 40 degrees 15’ W. The cold was now excessive, and\n      we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward. In this\n      direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon\n      to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising in tiers,\n      one mass above the other. Some driftwood floated by during the evening,\n      and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were nellies,\n      peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage. The\n      variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been previously to our\n      passing the Antarctic circle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 12.—Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing was\n      to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe,\n      backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which arose\n      frowningly above the other. We stood to the westward until the fourteenth,\n      in the hope of finding an entrance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 14.—This morning we reached the western extremity of the field\n      which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a\n      particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found a\n      current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour. The\n      temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. We\n      now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment\n      until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21’,\n      longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a current setting\n      still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour.\n      The variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature of the air\n      was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. At this\n      period not a particle of ice was to be discovered. All hands on board now\n      felt certain of attaining the pole.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 17.—This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of\n      birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the\n      deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating.\n      About midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the\n      larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. As the\n      weather was good and nearly calm, Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats\n      to see what it was. Dirk Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the\n      larger boat. Upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the\n      possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear, but far\n      exceeding in size the largest of these animals. Being well armed, we made\n      no scruple of attacking it at once. Several shots were fired in quick\n      succession, the most of which took effect, apparently, in the head and\n      body. Nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw himself from the\n      ice, and swam with open jaws, to the boat in which were Peters and myself.\n      Owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of\n      the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second shot, and the\n      bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our\n      gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small of his back, before any\n      efficient means were taken to repel him. In this extremity nothing but the\n      promptness and agility of Peters saved us from destruction. Leaping upon\n      the back of the huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the\n      neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. The brute tumbled into the sea\n      lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he fell. The\n      latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown him, he secured the\n      carcass before entering the boat. We then returned in triumph to the\n      schooner, towing our trophy behind us. This bear, upon admeasurement,\n      proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length. His wool was\n      perfectly white, and very coarse, curling tightly. The eyes were of a\n      blood red, and larger than those of the Arctic bear, the snout also more\n      rounded, rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. The meat was tender,\n      but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with avidity,\n      and declared it excellent eating.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead gave\n      the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!” All hands were now upon\n      the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward\n      and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. It proved to be a low\n      rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute\n      of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. In approaching it\n      from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the\n      sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton. Around\n      this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at the bottom of which our\n      boats effected a convenient landing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but, with\n      one exception, we found nothing worthy of our observation. In the southern\n      extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile of loose\n      stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe.\n      There had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and Captain Guy\n      fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the resemblance did\n      not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow, if such it were, we found\n      no other token that any living creature had ever been here before. Around\n      the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice—but these were\n      very few. The exact situation of the islet (to which Captain Guy gave the\n      name of Bennet’s Islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the\n      schooner) is 82 degrees 50’ S. latitude, 42 degrees 20’ W. longitude.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than\n      any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open before us.\n      We found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded,\n      and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature of the air, and\n      latterly of the water, became milder. The weather might even be called\n      pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some\n      northern point of the compass. The sky was usually clear, with now and\n      then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon—this,\n      however, was invariably of brief duration. Two difficulties alone\n      presented themselves to our view; we were getting short of fuel, and\n      symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew. These\n      considerations began to impress upon Captain Guy the necessity of\n      returning, and he spoke of it frequently. For my own part, confident as I\n      was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were\n      pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from present appearances,\n      that we should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher Arctic\n      latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering, at\n      least for a few days longer, in the direction we were now holding. So\n      tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an\n      Antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man, and I confess that\n      I felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and ill-timed\n      suggestions of our commander. I believe, indeed, that what I could not\n      refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to\n      push on. While, therefore, I cannot but lament the most unfortunate and\n      bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, I must still be\n      allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental,\n      however remotely, in opening to the eye of science one of the most\n      intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.19\"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>\n<p>\n      January 18.—This morning {*4} we continued to the southward, with\n      the same pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth, the air\n      tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water\n      fifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a\n      hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting toward the\n      pole at the rate of a mile an hour. This constant tendency to the\n      southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of\n      speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner, and\n      I saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of\n      Captain Guy. He was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and I\n      finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. The variation\n      was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several large whales\n      of the right species, and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over\n      the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full of red berries, like those of\n      the hawthorn, and the carcass of a singular-looking land-animal. It was\n      three feet in length, and but six inches in height, with four very short\n      legs, the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and\n      resembling coral in substance. The body was covered with a straight silky\n      hair, perfectly white. The tail was peaked like that of a rat, and about a\n      foot and a half long. The head resembled a cat’s, with the exception of\n      the ears—these were flopped like the ears of a dog. The teeth were\n      of the same brilliant scarlet as the claws.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      January 19.—To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20’, longitude 43\n      degrees 5’ W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again\n      saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be\n      one of a group of very large islands. The shore was precipitous, and the\n      interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us\n      great joy. In about four hours from our first discovering the land we came\n      to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high\n      surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer approach of\n      doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were now ordered out, and a\n      party, well armed (among whom were Peters and myself), proceeded to look\n      for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island. After\n      searching about for some time, we discovered an inlet, which we were\n      entering, when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore, filled\n      with men who seemed to be well armed. We waited for them to come up, and,\n      as they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail. Captain Guy\n      now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar, when the\n      strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once,\n      intermingled with occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the\n      words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! They continued this for at least half an\n      hour, during which we had a good opportunity of observing their\n      appearance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five broad,\n      there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They were about the ordinary\n      stature of Europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame. Their\n      complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. They were clothed\n      in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the\n      body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where turned\n      out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms consisted principally\n      of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy wood. Some spears, however,\n      were observed among them, headed with flint, and a few slings. The bottoms\n      of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended\n      their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up\n      in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats\n      alongside of him. This hint we pretended not to understand, thinking it\n      the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as their\n      number more than quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case, the\n      chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced\n      toward us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he leaped on board\n      the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of Captain Guy,\n      pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the word\n      Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We now put back to the vessel, the four canoes\n      following at a little distance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and\n      delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and laughing\n      obstreperously. His followers behind joined in his merriment, and for some\n      minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening. Quiet\n      being at length restored, Captain Guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up,\n      as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to\n      be Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his\n      men on deck at one time. With this arrangement he appeared perfectly\n      satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when one of them\n      approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off. Twenty of the\n      savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over every part of the\n      deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making themselves much at\n      home, and examining every article with great inquisitiveness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race—from\n      whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. They believed the Jane\n      to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the\n      points of their spears, carefully turning them up. Our crew were much\n      amused with the conduct of Too-wit in one instance. The cook was splitting\n      some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into the deck,\n      making a gash of considerable depth. The chief immediately ran up, and\n      pushing the cook on one side rather roughly, commenced a half whine, half\n      howl, strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings\n      of the schooner, patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing\n      it from a bucket of seawater which stood by. This was a degree of\n      ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part I could not help\n      thinking some of it affected.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity in\n      regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their amazement\n      exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep\n      for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low\n      ejaculations. The arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they\n      were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure. I do not believe that\n      they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for\n      idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we\n      watched their movements while handling them. At the great guns their\n      wonder was redoubled. They approached them with every mark of the\n      profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely. There\n      were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of their\n      amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got in the\n      middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the other,\n      before he fairly perceived them. Upon raising his eyes and seeing his\n      reflected self in the glass, I thought the savage would go mad; but, upon\n      turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time\n      in the opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon the spot. No\n      persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look; throwing himself\n      upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he remained thus until\n      we were obliged to drag him upon deck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty at\n      a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period. We saw\n      no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single article\n      after their departure. Throughout the whole of their visit they evinced\n      the most friendly manner. There were, however, some points in their\n      demeanour which we found it impossible to understand; for example, we\n      could not get them to approach several very harmless objects—such as\n      the schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. We\n      endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might\n      be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty in\n      being comprehended. We made out, nevertheless, what greatly astonished us,\n      that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of\n      which we saw in the canoe of Too-wit. We saw also some biche de mer in the\n      hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its natural\n      state. These anomalies—for they were such when considered in regard\n      to the latitude—induced Captain Guy to wish for a thorough\n      investigation of the country, in the hope of making a profitable\n      speculation in his discovery. For my own part, anxious as I was to know\n      something more of these islands, I was still more earnestly bent on\n      prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay. We had now fine\n      weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and being\n      already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us, a\n      current setting strongly to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not\n      listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was\n      absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a\n      proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. I represented to the captain\n      that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter here in the\n      event of being blocked up by the ice. He at length came into my views (for\n      in some way, hardly known to myself, I had acquired much influence over\n      him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding\n      biche de mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on\n      to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made every necessary\n      preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got the Jane through the\n      reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the shore, in an\n      excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern coast of the\n      main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy bottom. At the head\n      of this bay there were three fine springs (we were told) of good water,\n      and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. The four canoes followed us\n      in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. Too-wit himself remained\n      on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to accompany him on\n      shore, and visit his village in the interior. To this Captain Guy\n      consented; and ten savages being left on board as hostages, a party of us,\n      twelve in all, got in readiness to attend the chief. We took care to be\n      well armed, yet without evincing any distrust. The schooner had her guns\n      run out, her boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was\n      taken to guard against surprise. Directions were left with the chief mate\n      to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the event of our\n      not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, around\n      the island in search of us.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we\n      were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by\n      civilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant.\n      The trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the temperate, or the\n      northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike those of the lower\n      southern latitudes we had already traversed. The very rocks were novel in\n      their mass, their color, and their stratification; and the streams\n      themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common\n      with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them,\n      and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their\n      qualities were purely those of nature. At a small brook which crossed our\n      path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his attendants halted to\n      drink. On account of the singular character of the water, we refused to\n      taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was not until some time\n      afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the\n      streams throughout the whole group. I am at a loss to give a distinct idea\n      of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words.\n      Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water\n      would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade, had it the\n      customary appearance of limpidity. It was, nevertheless, in point of fact,\n      as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence, the difference\n      being only in appearance. At first sight, and especially in cases where\n      little declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards consistency,\n      to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. But this was only the\n      least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. It was not colourless,\n      nor was it of any one uniform colour—presenting to the eye, as it\n      flowed, every possible shade of purple; like the hues of a changeable\n      silk. This variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as\n      profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in\n      the case of Too-wit. Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle\n      thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a\n      number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not\n      commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own\n      particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins.\n      Upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over\n      it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces of the\n      passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. If, however, the blade\n      was passed down accurately between the two veins, a perfect separation was\n      effected, which the power of cohesion did not immediately rectify. The\n      phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain\n      of apparent miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.20\"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>\n<p>\n      We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than\n      nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country.\n      As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the whole hundred and ten\n      savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller\n      detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by\n      accident, at different turns of the road. There appeared so much of system\n      in this that I could not help feeling distrust, and I spoke to Captain Guy\n      of my apprehensions. It was now too late, however, to recede, and we\n      concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in\n      the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went on, keeping a wary eye upon\n      the manoeuvres of the savages, and not permitting them to divide our\n      numbers by pushing in between. In this way, passing through a precipitous\n      ravine, we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of\n      habitations upon the island. As we came in sight of them, the chief set up\n      a shout, and frequently repeated the word Klock-klock, which we supposed\n      to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic name for villages.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and,\n      unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are\n      acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of them (and these we found\n      belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the great men of the land) consisted\n      of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a large black\n      skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the ground. Under\n      this the savage nestled. Others were formed by means of rough limbs of\n      trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle\n      of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without regular\n      form, to the height of five or six feet. Others, again, were mere holes\n      dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered over with similar branches,\n      these being removed when the tenant was about to enter, and pulled on\n      again when he had entered. A few were built among the forked limbs of\n      trees as they stood, the upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to\n      bend over upon the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather.\n      The greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns,\n      apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone,\n      resembling fuller’s earth, with which three sides of the village were\n      bounded. At the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock,\n      which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his\n      residence, for what purpose I could not ascertain, as the stone itself was\n      never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some\n      depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous\n      ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all access in other\n      directions. Through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the\n      same magical-looking water which has been described. We saw several\n      strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly\n      domesticated. The largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in\n      the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and the\n      legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was exceedingly awkward\n      and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run. We noticed also\n      several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length of\n      body, and covered with a black wool. There were a great variety of tame\n      fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the\n      natives. To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a\n      state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically for food, but\n      always returning to the village as a home, and using the southern shore in\n      the vicinity as a place of incubation. There they were joined by their\n      friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never followed them to the\n      dwellings of the savages. Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks,\n      differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country, black\n      gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance, but not\n      carnivorous. Of fish there seemed to be a great abundance. We saw, during\n      our visit, a quantity of dried salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel,\n      blackfish, skate, conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish,\n      leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable\n      other varieties. We noticed, too, that most of them were similar to the\n      fish about the group of Lord Auckland Islands, in a latitude as low as\n      fifty-one degrees south. The Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful.\n      We saw but few wild animals, and none of a large size, or of a species\n      with which we were familiar. One or two serpents of a formidable aspect\n      crossed our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we\n      concluded that they were not venomous.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of\n      the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could\n      only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We were much\n      surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new comers\n      were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of the canoes.\n      All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the\n      latter, for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. There were\n      a great many women and children, the former not altogether wanting in what\n      might be termed personal beauty. They were straight, tall, and well\n      formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized\n      society. Their lips, however, like those of the men, were thick and\n      clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. Their\n      hair was of a finer texture than that of the males. Among these naked\n      villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the\n      party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed with lances and\n      heavy clubs. These appeared to have great influence among the rest, and\n      were always addressed by the title Wampoo. These, too, were the tenants of\n      the black skin palaces. That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the\n      village, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others\n      of its kind. The tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance\n      of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there were several\n      branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the covering,\n      and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk. The covering, too,\n      which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden\n      skewers, was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into\n      the ground. The floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of\n      carpet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the\n      natives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated himself on the\n      leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. This we did, and\n      presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not\n      indeed critical. We were on the ground, twelve in number, with the\n      savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us\n      that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to\n      make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet. The pressure\n      was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably was every\n      individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from trampling\n      us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations of Too-wit.\n      Our chief security lay, however, in the presence of Too-wit himself among\n      us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of\n      extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him immediately upon\n      the first appearance of hostile design.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when the chief\n      addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly resembling the\n      one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the Anamoo-moos! were\n      now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the Lama-Lamas! We\n      listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when\n      Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and\n      goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a present of several strings of\n      blue beads and a knife. At the former the monarch, much to our surprise,\n      turned up his nose with some expression of contempt, but the knife gave\n      him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner.\n      This was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and\n      consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown animal,\n      probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had observed in our approach\n      to the village. Seeing us at a loss how to proceed, he began, by way of\n      setting us an example, to devour yard after yard of the enticing food,\n      until we could positively stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest\n      symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of\n      astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the looking-glasses.\n      We declined, however, partaking of the delicacies before us, and\n      endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever,\n      having just finished a hearty dejeuner.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of\n      cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a view\n      of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and whether\n      any of them might be turned to profit. At length he seemed to have some\n      idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where\n      he assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that animal) was\n      to be found in great abundance. We were glad of this early opportunity of\n      escaping from the oppression of the crowd, and signified our eagerness to\n      proceed. We now left the tent, and, accompanied by the whole population of\n      the village, followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the\n      island, nor far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. We waited\n      here for about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some\n      of the savages to our station. The whole of our party then getting into\n      one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned,\n      and of another still farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of\n      biche de mer than the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups\n      of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. We\n      stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we\n      could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we\n      were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after\n      obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of\n      twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and Gallipago\n      tortoises as his canoes would hold. In the whole of this adventure we saw\n      nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion,\n      with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party\n      was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.21\"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>\n<p>\n      The chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully supplied\n      with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen,\n      and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being exceedingly\n      tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. Besides these, the savages brought us,\n      upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown\n      celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried.\n      The celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable\n      benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease.\n      In a very short time we had not a single person on the sick-list. We had\n      also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions, among which may be\n      mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the mussel in shape, but with\n      the taste of an oyster. Shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and\n      albatross and other birds’ eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a\n      plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before.\n      Most of the men found it a palatable food, but I thought it fishy and\n      otherwise disagreeable. In return for these good things we presented the\n      natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red\n      cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange. We established a\n      regular market on shore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our\n      barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith, and a\n      degree of order which their conduct at the village of <i>Klock-klock</i>\n      had not led us to expect from the savages.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which parties\n      of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and parties of our\n      men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the interior, and\n      receiving no molestation whatever. Finding the ease with which the vessel\n      might be loaded with <i>biche de mer</i>, owing to the friendly\n      disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they would\n      render us assistance in collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to enter into\n      negotiations with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to\n      cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering\n      as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the fine weather\n      to prosecute his voyage to the southward. Upon mentioning this project to\n      the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement. A bargain was\n      accordingly struck, perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it\n      was arranged that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying\n      off the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and doing\n      some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required, the\n      schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three of her men on the\n      island to superintend the fulfilment of the project, and instruct the\n      natives in drying the <i>biche de mer</i>. In regard to terms, these were\n      made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence. They were\n      to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so\n      forth, for every certain number of piculs of the <i>biche de mer</i> which\n      should be ready on our return.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and the\n      method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers, and I\n      can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of\n      it. The following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a\n      modern history of a voyage to the South Seas.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is that <i>mollusca</i> from the Indian Seas which is known to\n      commerce by the French name <i>bouche de mer</i> (a nice morsel from the\n      sea). If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls it <i>gasteropeda\n      pulmonifera</i>. It is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the Pacific\n      islands, and gathered especially for the Chinese market, where it commands\n      a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked-of edible birds’\n      nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a\n      species of swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have no shell,\n      no legs, nor any prominent part, except an <i>absorbing</i> and an <i>excretory</i>,\n      opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like caterpillars or worms,\n      they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low, they can be seen by a\n      kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted in the soft animal,\n      draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought\n      into the solid walls of their nest. Hence the name of <i>gasteropeda\n      pulmonifera</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen\n      inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not less than two feet\n      long. They were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies\n      next to the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches\n      thick. They crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year,\n      probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. It\n      is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that\n      they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so shallow that,\n      on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed to the beat of the sun.\n      But they do not bring forth their young in shallow water, as we never see\n      any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are always observed coming in\n      from deep water. They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which\n      produce the coral.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The <i>biche de mer</i> is generally taken in three or four feet of\n      water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a\n      knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the\n      mollusca. Through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure,\n      and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. The\n      article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which\n      must not be too much or too little. They are then buried in the ground for\n      four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are\n      dried, either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth the\n      most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.) can be cured that way, I can cure\n      thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly cured, they can be kept in a\n      dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they should be\n      examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to see if any\n      dampness is likely to affect them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The Chinese, as before stated, consider <i>biche de mer</i> a very great\n      luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the\n      system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary. The\n      first quality commands a high price in Canton, being worth ninety dollars\n      a picul; the second quality, seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty\n      dollars; the fourth, thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth,\n      twelve dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four dollars;\n      small cargoes, however, will often bring more in Manilla, Singapore, and\n      Batavia.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to\n      land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the\n      ground. A large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected,\n      where there was plenty of both wood and water, and within a convenient\n      distance of the principal reefs on which the <i>biche de mer</i> was to be\n      procured. We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great\n      astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of trees for\n      our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework of the\n      houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that we could\n      safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to\n      leave behind. These were John Carson, Alfred Harris, and ___ Peterson (all\n      natives of London, I believe), who volunteered their services in this\n      respect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure. We\n      had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leave-taking to the village,\n      and Too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that\n      we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final\n      refusal. I believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest\n      suspicion of the good faith of the savages. They had uniformly behaved\n      with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our work, offering\n      us their commodities, frequently without price, and never, in any\n      instance, pilfering a single article, although the high value they set\n      upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant\n      demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them a present.\n      The women especially were most obliging in every respect, and, upon the\n      whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we\n      entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who\n      treated us so well. A very short while sufficed to prove that this\n      apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan\n      for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we entertained such\n      inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the most barbarous, subtle, and\n      bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the face of the globe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the purpose of\n      visiting the village. Although, as said before, we entertained not the\n      slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. Six men\n      were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the savages\n      to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence whatever,\n      and to remain constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were up, the guns\n      double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded with\n      canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak, about a mile\n      from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any direction without\n      being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our swivels\n      immediately.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty-two\n      persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets,\n      pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long kind of seaman’s knife,\n      somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our\n      western and southern country. A hundred of the black skin warriors met us\n      at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. We noticed,\n      however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms;\n      and, upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he merely\n      answered that <i>Mattee non we pa pa si</i>—meaning that there was\n      no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in good part, and\n      proceeded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and were now\n      entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone hills\n      among which the village was situated. This gorge was very rocky and\n      uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled\n      through it on our first visit to Klock-klock. The whole length of the\n      ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two miles. It wound\n      in every possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed,\n      at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance proceeding\n      more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The sides of this dell\n      would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular\n      altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and in some portions they\n      arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the pass so completely that\n      but little of the light of day could penetrate. The general width was\n      about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the\n      passage of more than five or six persons abreast. In short, there could be\n      no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade,\n      and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms\n      as we entered upon it. When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief\n      subject of astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured,\n      under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown savages\n      as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress\n      through this ravine. Yet such was the order we blindly took up, trusting\n      foolishly to the force of our party, the unarmed condition of Too-wit and\n      his men, the certain efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a\n      secret to the natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained\n      pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. Five or six\n      of them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying\n      themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path. Next\n      came our own party. We walked closely together, taking care only to\n      prevent separation. Behind followed the main body of the savages,\n      observing unusual order and decorum.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the right of our\n      companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification of\n      the precipice which overhung us. A fissure in the soft rock attracted our\n      attention. It was about wide enough for one person to enter without\n      squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in\n      a straight course, sloping afterward to the left. The height of the\n      opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps\n      sixty or seventy feet. There were one or two stunted shrubs growing from\n      the crevices, bearing a species of filbert which I felt some curiosity to\n      examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or six of\n      the nuts at a grasp, and then hastily retreating. As I turned, I found\n      that Peters and Allen had followed me. I desired them to go back, as there\n      was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of my\n      nuts. They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allen being close\n      to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly aware of a concussion\n      resembling nothing I had ever before experienced, and which impressed me\n      with a vague conception, if indeed I then thought of anything, that the\n      whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that\n      the day of universal dissolution was at hand.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.22\"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>\n<p>\n      As soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself nearly\n      suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose\n      earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction,\n      threatening to bury me entirely. Horribly alarmed at this idea, I\n      struggled to gain my feet, and at last succeeded. I then remained\n      motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened to\n      me, and where I was. Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear, and\n      afterward the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the name\n      of God. I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell directly over\n      the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon discovered, was buried\n      in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling desperately\n      to free himself from the pressure. I tore the dirt from around him with\n      all the energy I could command, and at length succeeded in getting him\n      out.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be\n      capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion that the\n      walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some convulsion of\n      nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in overhead, and that we\n      were consequently lost for ever, being thus entombed alive. For a long\n      time we gave up supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as\n      cannot be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar\n      position. I firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in the course\n      of human events is more adapted to inspire the supremeness of mental and\n      bodily distress than a case like our own, of living inhumation. The\n      blackness of darkness which envelops the victim, the terrific oppression\n      of lungs, the stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly\n      considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that\n      such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into the human heart a\n      degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated—never to be\n      conceived.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely\n      the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it being barely\n      possible, he observed, that some opening might yet be left us for escape.\n      I caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to exertion, attempted\n      to force my way through the loose earth. Hardly had I advanced a single\n      step before a glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me\n      that, at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air. We\n      now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to hope for the\n      best. Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther\n      progress in the direction of the light, we found less difficulty in\n      advancing and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression\n      of lungs which had tormented us. Presently we were enabled to obtain a\n      glimpse of the objects around, and discovered that we were near the\n      extremity of the straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to\n      the left. A few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our\n      inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a\n      vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five degrees, although\n      sometimes much more precipitous. We could not see through the whole extent\n      of this opening; but, as a good deal of light came down it, we had little\n      doubt of finding at the top of it (if we could by any means reach the top)\n      a clear passage into the open air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the\n      main gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still missing; we\n      determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. After a long\n      search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above us,\n      Peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion’s foot,\n      and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the\n      possibility of extricating him. I soon found that what he said was too\n      true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct. With sorrowful\n      hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made our way\n      to the bend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after one\n      or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to despair. I\n      have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge\n      was composed of a species of soft rock resembling soapstone. The sides of\n      the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and\n      so excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little foothold\n      upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some places, where the\n      ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty was, of course, much\n      aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we thought insurmountable. We took\n      courage, however, from despair, and what, by dint of cutting steps in the\n      soft stone with our bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives,\n      to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and\n      then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a natural\n      platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity\n      of a thickly-wooded ravine. Looking back now, with somewhat more leisure,\n      at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw\n      from the appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we\n      concluded that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly\n      overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for\n      escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so weak that we\n      were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters now proposed that we\n      should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the\n      pistols which still remained in our girdles—the muskets as well as\n      cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm.\n      Subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have sorely\n      repented it, but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time\n      arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our\n      whereabouts.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the ravine,\n      and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous\n      yells. At length we reached what might be called the surface of the\n      ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had lain\n      beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance overhead.\n      With great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a\n      clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of\n      the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest\n      peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in which our party of\n      thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. But, for\n      at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely\n      filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and\n      stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. The means by which the\n      vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident, for\n      sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. In several spots\n      along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were now on the\n      western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth. In these\n      spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole extent of the\n      face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen, it was clear, from\n      marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock\n      blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted,\n      at not more than a yard apart, for the length of perhaps three hundred\n      feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf. Strong\n      cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the\n      hill, and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of\n      the other stakes. I have already spoken of the singular stratification of\n      these soapstone hills; and the description just given of the narrow and\n      deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will\n      afford a further conception of its nature. This was such that almost every\n      natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular\n      layers or ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate\n      exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose. Of\n      this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their\n      treacherous ends. There can be no doubt that, by the continuous line of\n      stakes, a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to\n      the depth of one or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end\n      of each of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the\n      stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage\n      power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a\n      given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below. The fate of our poor\n      companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty. We alone had escaped\n      from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction. We were the only living\n      white men upon the island.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.23\"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>\n<p>\n      Our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than when we\n      had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw before us no prospect but\n      that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging out a miserable\n      existence in captivity among them. We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves\n      for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and,\n      as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but we must\n      either perish in the long polar winter through cold and famine, or be\n      ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds of\n      whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the southward on\n      flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and\n      plunder of the Jane. The vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay,\n      those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting\n      them. How we longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in\n      effecting their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. We\n      saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing\n      immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a remote hope of\n      benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to apprise them that\n      something wrong had occurred; but the report could not possibly inform\n      them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour\n      forthwith—it could not tell them that no principles of honour now\n      bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer among the\n      living. Upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly\n      prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they\n      already were, and always had been. No good, therefore, and infinite harm,\n      would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we forbore.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to seize one of\n      the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to force a\n      passage on board. But the utter impossibility of succeeding in this\n      desperate task soon became evident. The country, as I said before, was\n      literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and\n      recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In our\n      immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which we\n      could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the\n      whole party of the black skin warriors, with Too-wit at their head, and\n      apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset upon\n      the Jane. The canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned\n      with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within\n      reach. We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our\n      place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which presently\n      ensued.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats,\n      without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern bight\n      of the harbor. They appeared to have no arms except short clubs, and\n      stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. Immediately afterward another\n      detachment, still larger, appeared in an opposite direction, and with\n      similar weapons. The four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with\n      natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off\n      swiftly to join the other parties. Thus, in less time than I have taken to\n      tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by an immense\n      multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant.\n      The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage in\n      her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns,\n      or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds. I could hardly imagine\n      that they would make resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for\n      presently I saw them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel’s\n      starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were\n      within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to\n      windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the agitation\n      of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation, the\n      discharge was an entire failure. Not a canoe was hit or a single savage\n      injured, the shots striking short and ricocheting over their heads. The\n      only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report\n      and smoke, which was so excessive that for some moments I almost thought\n      they would abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. And\n      this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their\n      broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes were now\n      so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing some execution,\n      sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a farther advance, until\n      they could have given the rafts also a broadside. But, in place of this,\n      they left the canoe party to recover from their panic, and, by looking\n      about them, to see that no injury had been sustained, while they flew to\n      the larboard to get ready for the rafts.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The star and\n      double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts\n      completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages\n      outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water,\n      the most of them dreadfully wounded. The remainder, frightened out of\n      their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to\n      pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every\n      direction, screaming and yelling for aid. This great success, however,\n      came too late for the salvation of our devoted people. The canoe party\n      were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred\n      and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains\n      and over the boarding-netting even before the matches had been applied to\n      the larboard guns. Nothing now could withstand their brute rage. Our men\n      were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely\n      torn to pieces in an instant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears, and\n      came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the Jane was a pitiable\n      scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. The decks were split open\n      and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything movable on deck\n      demolished as if by magic, while, by dint of pushing at the stern, towing\n      with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in thousands\n      around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable\n      having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of\n      Too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a\n      skilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among the hills,\n      but, now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction, condescended\n      to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin, and become a partaker\n      in the spoils.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and\n      reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty yards\n      from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked\n      the burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far from the spring we\n      discovered several of the filbert-bushes which I mentioned before. Upon\n      tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling in\n      flavour the common English filbert. We collected our hats full\n      immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more.\n      While we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes\n      alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert,\n      when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and slowly\n      arose above the shrubs. I was so much startled that I could do nothing,\n      but Peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could\n      make its escape, and seize it by the neck. Its struggles and screams were\n      tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise should\n      alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood.\n      A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length brought it to the ground,\n      and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating ourselves that, at all\n      events, we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a\n      week.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable\n      distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing\n      else which could serve us for food. We therefore collected a quantity of\n      dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on\n      their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who,\n      we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as\n      possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the\n      aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the\n      patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the\n      chasm. We left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of our\n      seeing the bay, without the risk of being discovered from below. Having\n      done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position;\n      for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose\n      to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the hill, We\n      could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this\n      hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the probability that the\n      fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the\n      fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other way of attaining it could be\n      perceived, we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure\n      from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left\n      us for descent. We resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly,\n      when a good opportunity should offer. In the meantime we watched the\n      motions of the savages through our loophole.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now\n      preparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the smoke ascending\n      in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and, shortly afterward, a dense\n      mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. The rigging, masts and what\n      remained of the sails caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly\n      along the decks. Still a great many of the savages retained their stations\n      about her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the\n      bolts and other iron and copper work. On the beach, and in canoes and\n      rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate vicinity of the\n      schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the shoals of them who, laden\n      with booty, were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring\n      islands. We now anticipated a catastrophe, and were not disappointed.\n      First of all there came a smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where\n      we were as if we had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any\n      visible signs of an explosion. The savages were evidently startled, and\n      paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. They were upon the\n      point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the\n      decks, resembling a black and heavy thundercloud—then, as if from\n      its bowels, arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently,\n      of a quarter of a mile—then there came a sudden circular expansion\n      of the flame—then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a\n      single instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs—and,\n      lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us\n      impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the\n      tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled\n      headlong in every direction around us.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and they\n      had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their treachery.\n      Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least an equal\n      number were desperately mangled. The whole surface of the bay was\n      literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and on shore\n      matters were even worse. They seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness\n      and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting\n      one another. At length we observed a total change in their demeanour. From\n      absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the highest\n      pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to and from a certain\n      point on the beach, with the strangest expressions of mingled horror,\n      rage, and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances, and shouting,\n      at the top of their voices, “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they returned\n      in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they brought to the\n      station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as to\n      afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. We perceived\n      something white lying upon the ground, but could not immediately make out\n      what it was. At length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange\n      animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up\n      at sea on the eighteenth of January. Captain Guy had had the body\n      preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England. I\n      remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the\n      island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of\n      the lockers. It had now been thrown on shore by the explosion; but why it\n      had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could\n      comprehend. Although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance,\n      none of them seemed willing to approach it closely. By-and-by the men with\n      the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner was this\n      arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast assemblage rushed into\n      the interior of the island, with loud screams of “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.24\"></a>CHAPTER 23</h2>\n<p>\n      During the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our\n      hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with the\n      greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had made a kind of\n      penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves, and\n      placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both fireplace\n      and table. We kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of\n      dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. The bird we had taken in\n      such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. It was\n      not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and grizzly\n      plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk. We afterward saw\n      three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine, apparently seeking\n      for the one we had captured; but, as they never alighted, we had no\n      opportunity of catching them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation, but it\n      was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that we\n      should look out for provision. The filberts would not satisfy the cravings\n      of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if\n      freely indulged in, with violent headache. We had seen several large\n      tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived\n      they might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the\n      observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to make an attempt\n      at descending.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer\n      the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before (as\n      we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop) our progress was\n      entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had\n      perished. We now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a\n      mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not\n      being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to\n      retrace our steps by the main ravine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune.\n      After an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we discovered\n      that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite, with fine\n      dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in\n      which we had come down. Toiling again up this path, we now tried the\n      northern edge of the hill. Here we were obliged to use the greatest\n      possible caution in our maneuvers, as the least indiscretion would expose\n      us to the full view of the savages in the village. We crawled along,\n      therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even forced to\n      throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies along by means of the\n      shrubbery. In this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way, when\n      we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading\n      directly into the main gorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we\n      found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below.\n      Thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our way back to\n      the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly\n      and soundly for some hours.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring\n      every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform ourselves of its\n      actual resources. We found that it would afford us no food, with the\n      exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass,\n      which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square, and would\n      be soon exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can\n      remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were growing\n      scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more lamentable. {*5} On\n      the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison, in hope of\n      finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose. We also descended the\n      chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of\n      discovering, through this channel, some opening to the main ravine. Here,\n      too, we were disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a\n      musket.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more\n      thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in\n      the first search. We remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of\n      this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to\n      explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any opening.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as\n      before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention.\n      It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and we\n      could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of\n      nature. The pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about five\n      hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance\n      from east to west in a straight line not being more (I should suppose,\n      having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty yards. Upon\n      first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a hundred feet\n      downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the abyss bore little\n      resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at no time been connected,\n      the one surface being of the soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated\n      with some metallic matter. The average breadth or interval between the two\n      cliffs was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no regularity\n      of formation. Passing down, however, beyond the limit spoken of, the\n      interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began to run parallel,\n      although, for some distance farther, they were still dissimilar in their\n      material and form of surface. Upon arriving within fifty feet of the\n      bottom, a perfect regularity commenced. The sides were now entirely\n      uniform in substance, in colour, and in lateral direction, the material\n      being a very black and shining granite, and the distance between the two\n      sides, at all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. The precise\n      formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a delineation\n      taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil,\n      which I preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent\n      adventure, and to which I am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which\n      would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This figure [No figures in text] gives the general outlines of the chasm,\n      without the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were several, each\n      cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite. The bottom of the\n      gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost\n      impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. To\n      the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance of a\n      small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to examine which\n      more minutely than before was the object of our second visit. We now\n      pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a quantity of brambles which\n      impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling\n      arrowheads in shape. We were encouraged to persevere, however, by\n      perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end. We at length\n      squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a\n      low and regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable\n      powder as that in the main chasm. A strong light now broke upon us, and,\n      turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another lofty chamber, similar\n      to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form. Its general\n      figure is here given.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening <i>a</i> and proceeding\n      round the curve <i>b</i> to the extremity <i>d</i>, is five hundred and\n      fifty yards. At <i>c</i> we discovered a small aperture similar to the one\n      through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up\n      in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead\n      flints. We forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long,\n      and emerged into a third chasm. This, too, was precisely like the first,\n      except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty\n      yards. At the point <i>a</i> was an opening about six feet wide, and\n      extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of\n      marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. We were about\n      leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted, when\n      Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in\n      the surface of the marl forming the termination of the <i>cul-de-sac</i>.\n      With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most northern\n      of these indentures might have been taken for the intentional, although\n      rude, representation of a human figure standing erect, with outstretched\n      arm. The rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical\n      characters, and Peters was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle\n      opinion that they were really such. I convinced him of his error, finally,\n      by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among the\n      powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of the marl,\n      which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface\n      where the indentures were found, and which had projecting points exactly\n      fitting the indentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no\n      means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and\n      dispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth mentioning occurred\n      during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground to\n      the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of great\n      depth, and also with black granite sides. Into these holes we did not\n      think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of\n      mere natural wells, without outlet. They were each about twenty yards in\n      circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in regard to\n      the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. {image}\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.25\"></a>CHAPTER 24</h2>\n<p>\n      On the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to subsist\n      any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the most\n      excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at\n      descending the southern declivity of the hill. The face of the precipice\n      was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly\n      perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty\n      feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. After a long\n      search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of\n      the gulf; upon this Peters contrived to leap, with what assistance I could\n      render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together. With\n      somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw the possibility\n      of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up\n      from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the hill—that is, by\n      cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with our knives. The extreme\n      hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no\n      other resource, we determined to undertake it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and to one\n      of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. The other end\n      being tied round Peters’ waist, I lowered him down over the edge of the\n      precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. He now proceeded\n      to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches),\n      sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as\n      to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg\n      into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for about four feet, when he\n      made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before, and\n      having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands. I now unfastened the\n      handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the\n      peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about\n      three feet lower than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of the\n      handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg. He then\n      drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold\n      with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It was now necessary to\n      untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with the view of fastening\n      them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in\n      cutting the holes at so great a distance apart. However, after one or two\n      unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold\n      on with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with his\n      right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to\n      the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a\n      station below the third, taking care not to go too far down. By these\n      means (means which I should never have conceived of myself, and for which\n      we were indebted altogether to Peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my\n      companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the\n      cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to follow\n      him; but I did at length attempt it. Peters had taken off his shirt before\n      descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary for the\n      adventure. After throwing down the musket found in the chasm, I fastened\n      this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving, by the\n      vigor of my movements, to banish the trepidation which I could overcome in\n      no other manner. This answered sufficiently well for the first four or\n      five steps; but presently I found my imagination growing terribly excited\n      by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the precarious\n      nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only support. It was\n      in vain I endeavored to banish these reflections, and to keep my eyes\n      steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me. The more\n      earnestly I struggled <i>not to think,</i>the more intensely vivid became\n      my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct. At length arrived that\n      crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we\n      began to anticipate the feelings with which we <i>shall</i>fall—to\n      picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle,\n      and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong\n      descent. And now I found these fancies creating their own realities, and\n      all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact. I felt my knees strike\n      violently together, while my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing\n      their grasp. There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, “This is my knell\n      of death!” And now I was consumed with the irrepressible desire of looking\n      below. I could not, I would not, confine my glances to the cliff; and,\n      with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror, half of a relieved\n      oppression, I threw my vision far down into the abyss. For one moment my\n      fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with the movement,\n      the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow,\n      through my mind—in the next my whole soul was pervaded with a\n      longing to fall; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. I\n      let go at once my grasp upon the peg, and, turning half round from the\n      precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked face. But\n      now there came a spinning of the brain; a shrill-sounding and phantom\n      voice screamed within my ears; a dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood\n      immediately beneath me; and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart,\n      and plunged within its arms.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. He had observed my\n      proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and perceiving my\n      imminent danger, had endeavored to inspire me with courage by every\n      suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so\n      great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he\n      had even spoken to me at all. At length, seeing me totter, he hastened to\n      ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. Had I\n      fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably have\n      snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss; as it was, he\n      contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended without danger\n      until animation returned. This was in about fifteen minutes. On recovery,\n      my trepidation had entirely vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some\n      little further aid from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb\n      of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had\n      fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought to\n      my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions\n      marking the site of degraded Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins of the\n      disrupted cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the\n      northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn\n      with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of art;\n      although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected. Scoria were\n      abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite, intermingled\n      with others of marl, {*6} and both granulated with metal. Of vegetation\n      there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area\n      within sight. Several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles\n      not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. As food was our most\n      immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the seacoast, distant not\n      more than half a mile, with a view of catching turtle, several of which we\n      had observed from our place of concealment on the hill. We had proceeded\n      some hundred yards, threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks\n      and tumuli, when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from\n      a small cavern, felling Peters to the ground with a blow from a club. As\n      he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim, leaving me\n      time to recover from my astonishment. I still had the musket, but the\n      barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that\n      I cast it aside as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been\n      carefully preserved in order. With these I advanced upon the assailants,\n      firing one after the other in quick succession. Two savages fell, and one,\n      who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters, sprung to his feet\n      without accomplishing his purpose. My companion being thus released, we\n      had no further difficulty. He had his pistols also, but prudently declined\n      using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded\n      that of any person I have ever known. Seizing a club from one of the\n      savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who\n      remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon,\n      and leaving us completely masters of the field.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe in\n      their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species\n      of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by the sound\n      of shouts in the distance. It was clear that the savages had been alarmed\n      by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. To\n      regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the\n      shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we should\n      never be able to ascend it without being seen. Our situation was one of\n      the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which path to commence a\n      flight, when one of the savages <i>whom</i>I had shot, and supposed dead,\n      sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his escape. We overtook\n      <i>him,</i>however, before he had advanced many paces, and were about to\n      put him to death, when Peters suggested that we might derive some benefit\n      from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape. We therefore\n      dragged him with us, making him understand that we would shoot him if he\n      offered resistance. In a few minutes he was perfectly submissive, and ran\n      by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks, making for the seashore.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the\n      sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it fairly\n      in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards distant. As we emerged into the\n      open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the natives\n      pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of the island,\n      making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like\n      wild beasts. We were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and trying\n      to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground, when I\n      discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock\n      which ran out into the water. Toward these we now ran with all speed, and,\n      reaching them, found them unguarded, and without any other freight than\n      three of the large Gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for\n      sixty rowers. We instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing\n      our captive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we could\n      command.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we\n      became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had\n      been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages, who,\n      by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves,\n      and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. No time was now to be lost. Our\n      hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. It was very\n      doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in time to\n      anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but yet there was a\n      chance that we could. We might save ourselves if we succeeded, while not\n      to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of\n      turning it around, we merely changed our position in paddling. As soon as\n      the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as their\n      speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. We pulled, however,\n      with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the contested point\n      before more than one of the natives had attained it. This man paid dearly\n      for his superior agility, Peters shooting him through the head with a\n      pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost among the rest of his\n      party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon\n      the canoe. We at first endeavored to pull her into the deep water, beyond\n      the reach of the savages, but, finding her too firmly aground, and there\n      being no time to spare, Peters, with one or two heavy strokes from the\n      butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow\n      and of one side. We then pushed off. Two of the natives by this time had\n      got hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were forced\n      to despatch them with our knives. We were now clear off, and making great\n      way out to sea. The main body of the savages, upon reaching the broken\n      canoe, set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment\n      conceivable. In truth, from everything I could see of these wretches, they\n      appeared to be the most wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty,\n      and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. It is\n      clear we should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They\n      made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it\n      useless, again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and\n      rushed up into the hills.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still\n      sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at\n      one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the fact\n      (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had been blown\n      to pieces in the explosion of the <i>Jane Guy.</i>We calculated,\n      therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round\n      to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid\n      up. Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind us,\n      and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to take a paddle.\n      In about half an hour, when we had gained probably five or six miles to\n      the southward, a large fleet of the flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were\n      seen to emerge from the bay evidently with the design of pursuit.\n      Presently they put back, despairing to overtake us.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.26\"></a>CHAPTER 25</h2>\n<p>\n      We now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean, in a\n      latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no\n      provision but the three turtles. The long polar winter, too, could not be\n      considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should\n      deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. There were six or seven\n      islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each other\n      about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention\n      to venture. In coming from the northward in the <i>Jane Guy</i> we had\n      been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice—this, however\n      little it maybe in accordance with the generally received notions\n      respecting the Antarctic, was a fact—experience would not permit us\n      to deny. To attempt, therefore, getting back would be folly—especially\n      at so late a period of the season. Only one course seemed to be left open\n      for hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there was at\n      least a probability of discovering other lands, and more than a\n      probability of finding a still milder climate.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean, peculiarly free\n      from violent storms or immoderately rough water; but our canoe was, at\n      best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to work with a\n      view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would\n      admit. The body of the boat was of no better material than bark—the\n      bark of a tree unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to\n      the purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet room from stem to\n      stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout four feet and\n      a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other\n      inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with whom civilized nations are\n      acquainted. We never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant\n      islanders who owned them; and some days after this period discovered, by\n      questioning our captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a\n      group to the southwest of the country where we found them, having fallen\n      accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. What we could do for the\n      security of our boat was very little indeed. Several wide rents were\n      discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to patch up with pieces\n      of woollen jacket. With the help of the superfluous paddles, of which\n      there were a great many, we erected a kind of framework about the bow, so\n      as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that\n      quarter. We also set up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite\n      each other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. To\n      these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this with some\n      difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever,\n      although he had been willing enough to labor in all the other operations.\n      The sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner. He\n      could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we\n      attempted to force him, and shrieking out, <i>“Tekeli-li!”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe,\n      we now set sail to the south-southeast for the present, with the view of\n      weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. This being done, we\n      turned the bow full to the southward. The weather could by no means be\n      considered disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the\n      northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice whatever was to be\n      seen; <i>nor did I ever see one particle of this after leaving the\n      parallel of Bennet’s Islet.</i>Indeed, the temperature of the water was\n      here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. Having killed the\n      largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food but a\n      copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any incident\n      of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must\n      have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew\n      constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in the\n      direction we were pursuing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 1st</i>. {*7}-Many unusual phenomena now—indicated that we\n      were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. A high range of light\n      gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up\n      occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from\n      west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit—in short,\n      having all the wild variations of the Aurora Borealis. The average height\n      of this vapor, as apparent from our station, was about twenty-five\n      degrees. The temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily,\n      and there was a very perceptible alteration in its color.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 2d.</i>-To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we came to\n      the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre,\n      its inhabitants, and customs—but with these how can I now detain the\n      reader? I may say, however, that we learned there were eight islands in\n      the group—that they were governed by a common king, named <i>Tsalemon</i>or\n      <i>Psalemoun,</i>who resided in one of the smallest of the islands; that\n      the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of\n      huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the king—that the\n      inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the flat-bottomed\n      rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession, and,\n      these having been obtained, by mere accident, from some large island in\n      the southwest—that his own name was Nu-Nu—that he had no knowledge of\n      Bennet’s Islet—and that the appellation of the island he had left was\n      Tsalal. The commencement of the words <i>Tsalemon</i>and Tsalal was given\n      with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate,\n      even after repeated endeavors, and which was precisely the same with the\n      note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit of the hill.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 3d.</i>-The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and in\n      color was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a\n      milky consistency and hue. In our immediate vicinity it was usually\n      smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe—but we were frequently\n      surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances,\n      sudden and extensive agitations of the surface; these, we at length\n      noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor\n      to the southward.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 4th.</i>-To-day, with the view of widening our sail, the breeze\n      from the northward dying away perceptibly, I took from my coat-pocket a\n      white handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen\n      accidentally flaring in his face, he became violently affected with\n      convulsions. These were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor, and low\n      murmurings of <i>“‘Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>March</i>5th.-The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that we\n      were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a powerful\n      current. And now,—indeed, it would seem reasonable that we should\n      experience some alarm at the turn events were taking—but we felt none. The\n      countenance of Peters indicated nothing of this nature, although it wore\n      at times an expression I could not fathom. The polar winter appeared to be\n      coming on—but coming without its terrors. I felt a numbness of body\n      and mind—a dreaminess of sensation but this was all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 6th.</i>-The gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees above\n      the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint. The heat of\n      the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was\n      more evident than ever. Today a violent agitation of the water occurred\n      very close to the canoe. It was attended, as usual, with a wild flaring up\n      of the vapor at its summit, and a momentary division at its base. A fine\n      white powder, resembling ashes—but certainly not such—fell over the canoe\n      and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering died away among\n      the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea. Nu-Nu now threw himself\n      on his face in the bottom of the boat, and no persuasions could induce him\n      to arise.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 7th.</i>-This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives of\n      his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too\n      utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply. He still\n      obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon reiterating the\n      questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic gesticulations, such\n      as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and displaying the teeth\n      which lay beneath it. These were black. We had never before seen the teeth\n      of an inhabitant of Tsalal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 8th.</i>-To-day there floated by us one of the white animals\n      whose appearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild a\n      commotion among the savages. I would have picked it up, but there came\n      over me a sudden listlessness, and I forbore. The heat of the water still\n      increased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it. Peters spoke\n      little, and I knew not what to think of his apathy. Nu-Nu breathed, and no\n      more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 9th.</i>-The whole ashy material fell now continually around us,\n      and in vast quantities. The range of vapor to the southward had arisen\n      prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness of\n      form. I can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract, rolling silently\n      into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in the heaven. The\n      gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the southern horizon. It\n      emitted no sound.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 21st.</i>-A sullen darkness now hovered above us—but from out the\n      milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along the\n      bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower\n      which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the water as it\n      fell. The summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the\n      distance. Yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. At\n      intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and\n      from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct\n      images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless winds, tearing up the\n      enkindled ocean in their course.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>March 22d.</i>-The darkness had materially increased, relieved only by\n      the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us. Many\n      gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the\n      veil, and their scream was the eternal <i>Tekeli-li!</i>as they retreated\n      from our vision. Hereupon Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but\n      upon touching him we found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into the\n      embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us.\n      But there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far larger in\n      its proportions than any dweller among men. And the hue of the skin of the\n      figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      NOTE\n    </p>\n<p>\n      THE circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of\n      Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the\n      daily press. It is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to\n      have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him, while the\n      above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably\n      lost through the accident by which he perished himself. This, however, may\n      prove not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be\n      given to the public.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The gentleman\n      whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement there\n      made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined the\n      task—this, for satisfactory reasons connected with the general inaccuracy\n      of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the\n      latter portions of the narration. Peters, from whom some information might\n      be expected, is still alive, and a resident of Illinois, but cannot be met\n      with at present. He may hereafter be found, and will, no doubt, afford\n      material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym’s account.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two or three)\n      is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be doubted they\n      contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at least to regions in\n      its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in\n      relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means\n      of the governmental expedition now preparing for the Southern Ocean.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered; and it\n      would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here\n      observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon the\n      very singular pages now published. We allude to the chasms found in the\n      island of Tsalal, and to the whole of the figures upon pages 245-47 {of\n      the printed edition—ed.}.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (Note: No figures were included with this text)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and speaks\n      decidedly of the <i>indentures</i>found at the extremity of the most\n      easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to\n      alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively <i>not such.\n     </i>This assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a\n      species of demonstration so conclusive (viz., the fitting of the\n      projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures upon\n      the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no\n      reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in relation\n      to all the figures are most singular (especially when taken in connection\n      with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as well to\n      say a word or two concerning them all—this, too, the more especially as\n      the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the attention of Mr.\n      Poe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Figure 1, then, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined with one\n      another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented, and\n      when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it will be\n      remembered, served only as a means of communication between the main\n      chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an Ethiopian\n      verbal root—the root “To be shady,’—whence all the inflections of\n      shadow or darkness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in figure 4,\n      it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was correct, and that\n      the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art, and intended as\n      the representation of a human form. The delineation is before the reader,\n      and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest\n      of the indentures afford strong confirmation of Peters’ idea. The upper\n      range is evidently the Arabic verbal root “To be white,” whence all the\n      inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. The lower range is not so\n      immediately perspicuous. The characters are somewhat broken and\n      disjointed; nevertheless, it can not be doubted that, in their perfect\n      state, they formed the full Egyptian word, “The region of the south.” It\n      should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of\n      Peters in regard to the “most northwardly” of the figures. The arm is\n      outstretched toward the south.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting\n      conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in connection with some of\n      the most faintly detailed incidents of the narrative; although in no\n      visible manner is this chain of connection complete. Tekeli-li! was the\n      cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcase of\n      the <i>white</i>animal picked up at sea. This also was the shuddering\n      exclamatives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the <i>white</i>materials\n      in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the shriek of the swift-flying, <i>white,\n     </i>and gigantic birds which issued from the vapory <i>white</i>curtain\n      of the South. Nothing <i>white</i>was to be found at Tsalal, and nothing\n      otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond. It is not\n      impossible that “Tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the chasms, may\n      be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some\n      alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the Ethiopian\n      characters so mysteriously written in their windings.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>“I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the dust\n      within the rock.”</i>\n</p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.27\"></a>NOTES TO THE THIRD VOLUME</h2>\n<p>\n      {*1} Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks—why the\n      <i>Grampus</i> was not I have never been able to ascertain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      {*2} The case of the brig <i>Polly</i>, of Boston, is one so much in\n      point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own,\n      that I cannot forbear alluding to it here. This vessel, of one hundred and\n      thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a cargo of lumber and\n      provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth of December, 1811, under the\n      command of Captain Casneau. There were eight souls on board besides the\n      captain—the mate, four seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr.\n      Hunt, and a negro girl belonging to him. On the fifteenth, having cleared\n      the shoal of Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the\n      southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board,\n      she afterward righted. They remained in this situation, without fire, and\n      with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and ninety-one\n      days (from December the fifteenth to June the twentieth), when Captain\n      Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only survivors, were taken off the wreck by\n      the Fame, of Hull, Captain Featherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro. When\n      picked up, they were in latitude 28 degrees N., longitude 13 degrees W.,\n      having drifted above two thousand miles! On the ninth of July the Fame\n      fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins, who landed the two\n      sufferers in Kennebeck. The narrative from which we gather these details\n      ends in the following words:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance, upon\n      the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not be discovered all this\n      time. They were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of which came so\n      nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the\n      rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the\n      starving and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion,\n      hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      {*3} Among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with\n      the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in 1769; the ship\n      Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the ship Dolores, in 1790.\n      They all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      {*4} The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to avoid\n      confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of course, be\n      taken in their ordinary sense. For a long time past we had had no night at\n      all, the daylight being continual. The dates throughout are according to\n      nautical time, and the bearing must be understood as per compass. I would\n      also remark, in this place, that I cannot, in the first portion of what is\n      here written, pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes\n      and longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period of\n      which this first portion treats. In many instances I have relied\n      altogether upon memory.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      {*5} This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south\n      several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken of.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      {*6} The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light colored\n      substances of any kind upon the island.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      {*7}For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in these\n      dates.

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.28\"></a>LIGEIA</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n      And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of\n      the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things\n      by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor\n      unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.—<i>Joseph\n      Glanvill</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I\n      first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years have since\n      elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I\n      cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character\n      of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty,\n      and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language,\n      made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily\n      progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I believe that\n      I met her first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city\n      near the Rhine. Of her family—I have surely heard her speak. That\n      it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia!\n      Buried in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden\n      impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone—by\n      Ligeia—that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who\n      is no more. And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I\n      have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my\n      betrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife\n      of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia? or was it\n      a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no inquiries\n      upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own—a wildly\n      romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion? I but\n      indistinctly recall the fact itself—what wonder that I have utterly\n      forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it? And, indeed,\n      if ever that spirit which is entitled <i>Romance</i>—if ever she,\n      the wan and the misty-winged <i>Ashtophet</i> of idolatrous Egypt,\n      presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she\n      presided over mine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is\n      the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in\n      her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray the\n      majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible\n      lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came and departed as a\n      shadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save\n      by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand\n      upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was\n      the radiance of an opium-dream—an airy and spirit-lifting vision\n      more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the\n      slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of\n      that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the\n      classical labors of the heathen. “There is no exquisite beauty,” says\n      Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty,\n      “without some strangeness in the proportion.” Yet, although I saw that the\n      features of Ligeia were not of a classic regularity—although I\n      perceived that her loveliness was indeed “exquisite,” and felt that there\n      was much of “strangeness” pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect\n      the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the strange.” I\n      examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead—it was faultless—how\n      cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine!—the skin\n      rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle\n      prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the\n      glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the\n      full force of the Homeric epithet, “hyacinthine!” I looked at the delicate\n      outlines of the nose—and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of\n      the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection. There were the same\n      luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to\n      the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free\n      spirit. I regarded the sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all\n      things heavenly—the magnificent turn of the short upper lip—the\n      soft, voluptuous slumber of the under—the dimples which sported, and\n      the color which spoke—the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy\n      almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her\n      serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I\n      scrutinized the formation of the chin—and here, too, I found the\n      gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the\n      spirituality, of the Greek—the contour which the god Apollo revealed\n      but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian. And then I peered\n      into the large eyes of Ligeia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been,\n      too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam\n      alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of\n      our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes\n      of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals—in\n      moments of intense excitement—that this peculiarity became more than\n      slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty—in\n      my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps—the beauty of beings either\n      above or apart from the earth—the beauty of the fabulous Houri of\n      the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far\n      over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows, slightly\n      irregular in outline, had the same tint. The “strangeness,” however, which\n      I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or the\n      color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred\n      to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of\n      mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The\n      expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long hours have I pondered upon\n      it! How have I, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to\n      fathom it! What was it—that something more profound than the well of\n      Democritus—which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? What was\n      it? I was possessed with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large,\n      those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda,\n      and I to them devoutest of astrologers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the\n      science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact—never, I\n      believe, noticed in the schools—that, in our endeavors to recall to\n      memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very\n      verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And\n      thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia’s eyes, have I felt\n      approaching the full knowledge of their expression—felt it\n      approaching—yet not quite be mine—and so at length entirely\n      depart! And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the\n      commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that\n      expression. I mean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia’s\n      beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived,\n      from many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt\n      always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more\n      could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I\n      recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing\n      vine—in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a\n      stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean—in the falling of a\n      meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people. And there\n      are one or two stars in heaven—(one especially, a star of the sixth\n      magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)\n      in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling. I\n      have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and\n      not unfrequently by passages from books. Among innumerable other\n      instances, I well remember something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which\n      (perhaps merely from its quaintness—who shall say?) never failed to\n      inspire me with the sentiment: “And the will therein lieth, which\n      dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God\n      is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man\n      doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only\n      through the weakness of his feeble will.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace,\n      indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English\n      moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An intensity in\n      thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an\n      index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse,\n      failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. Of all\n      the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid\n      Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern\n      passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the\n      miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled\n      me—by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness and\n      placidity of her very low voice—and by the fierce energy (rendered\n      doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wild\n      words which she habitually uttered.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense—such as I\n      have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply\n      proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the\n      modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault. Indeed upon\n      any theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the\n      boasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How\n      singularly—how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife\n      has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her\n      knowledge was such as I have never known in woman—but where breathes\n      the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral,\n      physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now clearly\n      perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding;\n      yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself,\n      with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of\n      metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily occupied during the\n      earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a triumph—with how\n      vivid a delight—with how much of all that is ethereal in hope did\n      I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little sought—but less\n      known—that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me, down\n      whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length pass\n      onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years,\n      I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly\n      away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her presence,\n      her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the\n      transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of\n      her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead.\n      And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over\n      which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a too—too\n      glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue\n      of the grave; and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank\n      impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion. I saw that she must die—and\n      I struggled desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles\n      of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than\n      my own. There had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the\n      belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors; but\n      not so. Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of\n      resistance with which she wrestled with the Shadow. I groaned in anguish\n      at the pitiable spectacle. I would have soothed—I would have\n      reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,—for\n      life—but for life—solace and reason were the uttermost folly.\n      Yet not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her\n      fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her\n      voice grew more gentle—grew more low—yet I would not wish to\n      dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled\n      as I hearkened, entranced, to a melody more than mortal—to\n      assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily\n      aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary\n      passion. But in death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her\n      affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me\n      the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to\n      idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?—how\n      had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour\n      of her making them? But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me\n      say only, that in Ligeia’s more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas!\n      all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the\n      principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life\n      which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this wild longing—it is\n      this eager vehemence of desire for life—but for life—that I\n      have no power to portray—no utterance capable of expressing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,\n      peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by\n      herself not many days before. I obeyed her. They were these:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nLo! ’tis a gala night<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the lonesome latter years!<br>\nAn angel throng, bewinged, bedight<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In veils, and drowned in tears,<br>\nSit in a theatre, to see<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A play of hopes and fears,<br>\nWhile the orchestra breathes fitfully<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of the spheres.<br>\n<br>\nMimes, in the form of God on high,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutter and mumble low,<br>\nAnd hither and thither fly;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere puppets they, who come and go<br>\nAt bidding of vast formless things<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shift the scenery to and fro,<br>\nFlapping from out their Condor wings<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible Wo!<br>\n<br>\nThat motley drama!—oh, be sure<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall not be forgot!<br>\nWith its Phantom chased forever more,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a crowd that seize it not,<br>\nThrough a circle that ever returneth in<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the self-same spot,<br>\nAnd much of Madness and more of Sin<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Horror the soul of the plot.<br>\n<br>\nBut see, amid the mimic rout,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crawling shape intrude!<br>\nA blood-red thing that writhes from out<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenic solitude!<br>\nIt writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mimes become its food,<br>\nAnd the seraphs sob at vermin fangs<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human gore imbued.<br>\n<br>\nOut—out are the lights—out all!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over each quivering form,<br>\nThe curtain, a funeral pall,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes down with the rush of a storm,<br>\nAnd the angels, all pallid and wan,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprising, unveiling, affirm<br>\nThat the play is the tragedy, “Man,”<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its hero the Conqueror Worm.\n</p>\n<p>\n      “O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms\n      aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines—“O\n      God! O Divine Father!—shall these things be undeviatingly so?—shall\n      this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and parcel in Thee?\n      Who—who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor? Man doth\n      not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the\n      weakness of his feeble will.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to\n      fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her\n      last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I\n      bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of the\n      passage in Glanvill—“Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto\n      death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      She died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no\n      longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying\n      city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia\n      had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of\n      mortals. After a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I\n      purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in\n      one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The\n      gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of\n      the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected with\n      both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had\n      driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. Yet\n      although the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it,\n      suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity,\n      and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of\n      more than regal magnificence within. For such follies, even in\n      childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the\n      dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness might\n      have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the\n      solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the\n      Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! I had become a bounden\n      slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a\n      coloring from my dreams. But these absurdities I must not pause to detail.\n      Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment\n      of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride—as the\n      successor of the unforgotten Ligeia—the fair-haired and blue-eyed\n      Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that\n      bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where were the souls of\n      the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they\n      permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and\n      a daughter so beloved? I have said that I minutely remember the details of\n      the chamber—yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment—and\n      here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take\n      hold upon the memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated\n      abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying the whole\n      southern face of the pentagon was the sole window—an immense sheet\n      of unbroken glass from Venice—a single pane, and tinted of a leaden\n      hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing through it, fell\n      with a ghastly lustre on the objects within. Over the upper portion of\n      this huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which\n      clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking\n      oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the\n      wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical\n      device. From out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting,\n      depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the\n      same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived\n      that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent\n      vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in\n      various stations about—and there was the couch, too—bridal\n      couch—of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony,\n      with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood\n      on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the\n      kings over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial\n      sculpture. But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief\n      phantasy of all. The lofty walls, gigantic in height—even\n      unproportionably so—were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds,\n      with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry—tapestry of a material\n      which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the\n      ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous\n      volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window. The material\n      was the richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular\n      intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought\n      upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. But these figures\n      partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a\n      single point of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to\n      a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To\n      one entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities;\n      but upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and step\n      by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself\n      surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to\n      the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the\n      monk. The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial\n      introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies—giving\n      a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In halls such as these—in a bridal chamber such as this—I\n      passed, with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month\n      of our marriage—passed them with but little disquietude. That my\n      wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper—that she shunned me\n      and loved me but little—I could not help perceiving; but it gave me\n      rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with a hatred belonging more\n      to demon than to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of\n      regret!) to Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed.\n      I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty,\n      her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then,\n      did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her\n      own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered\n      in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during the\n      silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day,\n      as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor\n      of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had\n      abandoned—ah, could it be forever?—upon the earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady\n      Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow.\n      The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her\n      perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in\n      and about the chamber of the turret, which I concluded had no origin save\n      in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences\n      of the chamber itself. She became at length convalescent—finally\n      well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder\n      again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame,\n      at all times feeble, never altogether recovered. Her illnesses were, after\n      this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming recurrence,\n      defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians.\n      With the increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken\n      too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, I\n      could not fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of\n      her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear. She\n      spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds—of\n      the slight sounds—and of the unusual motions among the tapestries,\n      to which she had formerly alluded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing\n      subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just\n      awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings\n      half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated\n      countenance. I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans\n      of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of\n      sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear—of motions\n      which she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was rushing\n      hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me\n      confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost inarticulate\n      breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall,\n      were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind. But a\n      deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions\n      to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and no\n      attendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited a decanter\n      of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened\n      across the chamber to procure it. But, as I stepped beneath the light of\n      the censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my\n      attention. I had felt that some palpable although invisible object had\n      passed lightly by my person; and I saw that there lay upon the golden\n      carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a\n      shadow—a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect—such as\n      might be fancied for the shadow of a shade. But I was wild with the\n      excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but\n      little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed\n      the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of the\n      fainting lady. She had now partially recovered, however, and took the\n      vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes\n      fastened upon her person. It was then that I became distinctly aware of a\n      gentle footfall upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second\n      thereafter, as Rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I\n      saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if from\n      some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or four large\n      drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If this I saw—not so\n      Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to\n      her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but\n      the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the\n      terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately\n      subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse\n      took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent\n      night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the\n      fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber\n      which had received her as my bride. Wild visions, opium-engendered,\n      flitted, shadow-like, before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the\n      sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the\n      drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer\n      overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a\n      former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen\n      the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer; and\n      breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid and\n      rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of\n      Ligeia—and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence\n      of a flood, the whole of that unutterable woe with which I had regarded her\n      thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter\n      thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the\n      body of Rowena.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken\n      no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me\n      from my revery. I <i>felt</i> that it came from the bed of ebony—the\n      bed of death. I listened in an agony of superstitious terror—but\n      there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision to detect any\n      motion in the corpse—but there was not the slightest perceptible.\n      Yet I could not have been deceived. I had heard the noise, however faint,\n      and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my\n      attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any\n      circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At length\n      it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable\n      tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken\n      small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of unutterable horror and\n      awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic\n      expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I\n      sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. I\n      could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations—that\n      Rowena still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made;\n      yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by\n      the servants—there were none within call—I had no means of\n      summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes—and\n      this I could not venture to do. I therefore struggled alone in my\n      endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering. In a short period it was\n      certain, however, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared\n      from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of\n      marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly\n      expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread\n      rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous illness\n      immediately supervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from\n      which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to\n      passionate waking visions of Ligeia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second time\n      aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I listened—in\n      extremity of horror. The sound came again—it was a sigh. Rushing to\n      the corpse, I saw—distinctly saw—a tremor upon the lips. In a\n      minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly\n      teeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had\n      hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that my\n      reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that I at length\n      succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had\n      pointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the\n      cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was\n      even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with redoubled\n      ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration. I chafed and bathed the\n      temples and the hands, and used every exertion which experience, and no\n      little medical reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color\n      fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead,\n      and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy\n      chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and\n      all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a\n      tenant of the tomb.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia—and again, (what marvel that\n      I shudder while I write?), again there reached my ears a low sob from the\n      region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable\n      horrors of that night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time,\n      until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of\n      revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a\n      sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the\n      aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was\n      succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of\n      the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been\n      dead, once again stirred—and now more vigorously than hitherto,\n      although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter\n      hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and\n      remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of\n      violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the\n      least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously\n      than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the\n      countenance—the limbs relaxed—and, save that the eyelids were\n      yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the\n      grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have\n      dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death.\n      But if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could at least\n      doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps,\n      with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the\n      thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of\n      the apartment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I trembled not—I stirred not—for a crowd of unutterable\n      fancies connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure,\n      rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed—had chilled me\n      into stone. I stirred not—but gazed upon the apparition. There was a\n      mad disorder in my thoughts—a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed,\n      be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it indeed be Rowena at all—the\n      fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why\n      should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about the mouth—but then\n      might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the\n      cheeks—there were the roses as in her noon of life—yes, these might\n      indeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,\n      with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?—but had she\n      then grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness seized me\n      with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her feet! Shrinking from\n      my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements\n      which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing\n      atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; <i>it\n      was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight!</i> And now slowly opened\n      the eyes of the figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,” I\n      shrieked aloud, “can I never—can I never be mistaken—these are\n      the full, and the black, and the wild eyes—of my lost love—of\n      the Lady—of the L<small>ADY</small> L<small>IGEIA</small>.”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.29\"></a>MORELLA</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n     Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—P<small>LATO</small>—<i>Sympos</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my friend\n      Morella. Thrown by accident into her society many years ago, my soul from\n      our first meeting, burned with fires it had never before known; but the\n      fires were not of Eros, and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the\n      gradual conviction that I could in no manner define their unusual meaning\n      or regulate their vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us together\n      at the altar; and I never spoke of passion nor thought of love. She,\n      however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone rendered me\n      happy. It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to dream.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Morella’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents were of\n      no common order—her powers of mind were gigantic. I felt this, and,\n      in many matters, became her pupil. I soon, however, found that, perhaps on\n      account of her Presburg education, she placed before me a number of those\n      mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the early\n      German literature. These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her\n      favourite and constant study—and that in process of time they became\n      my own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence of\n      habit and example.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My convictions, or\n      I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by the ideal, nor was any\n      tincture of the mysticism which I read to be discovered, unless I am\n      greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts. Persuaded of this,\n      I abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with\n      an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. And then—then,\n      when, poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden spirit enkindling\n      within me—would Morella place her cold hand upon my own, and rake up\n      from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular words, whose\n      strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory. And then, hour after\n      hour, would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of her voice,\n      until at length its melody was tainted with terror, and there fell a\n      shadow upon my soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too\n      unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and the most\n      beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became Ge-Henna.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions\n      which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned, formed, for so long a\n      time, almost the sole conversation of Morella and myself. By the learned\n      in what might be termed theological morality they will be readily\n      conceived, and by the unlearned they would, at all events, be little\n      understood. The wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the\n      Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urged by\n      Schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting the most of\n      beauty to the imaginative Morella. That identity which is termed personal,\n      Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to consist in the saneness of rational\n      being. And since by person we understand an intelligent essence having\n      reason, and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies\n      thinking, it is this which makes us all to be that which we call\n      <i>ourselves</i>—thereby distinguishing us from other beings that think, and\n      giving us our personal identity. But the <i>principium indivduationis</i>, the\n      notion of that identity <i>which at death is or is not lost forever</i>—was to\n      me, at all times, a consideration of intense interest; not more from the\n      perplexing and exciting nature of its consequences, than from the marked\n      and agitated manner in which Morella mentioned them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife’s manner\n      oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer bear the touch of her wan\n      fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language, nor the lustre of her\n      melancholy eyes. And she knew all this, but did not upbraid; she seemed\n      conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She\n      seemed, also, conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual\n      alienation of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature.\n      Yet was she woman, and pined away daily. In time the crimson spot settled\n      steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became\n      prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity, but in, next I met\n      the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul sickened and became giddy\n      with the giddiness of one who gazes downward into some dreary and\n      unfathomable abyss.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming desire for\n      the moment of Morella’s decease? I did; but the fragile spirit clung to\n      its tenement of clay for many days—for many weeks and irksome months,\n      until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew\n      furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and\n      the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as\n      her gentle life declined—like shadows in the dying of the day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven, Morella\n      called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all the earth, and a\n      warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich October leaves of the forest,\n      a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached; “a day of all days\n      either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of earth and life—ah,\n      more fair for the daughters of heaven and death!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I kissed her forehead, and she continued:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I am dying, yet shall I live.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Morella!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The days have never been when thou couldst love me—but her whom in\n      life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Morella!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that affection—ah,\n      how little!—which thou didst feel for me, Morella. And when my\n      spirit departs shall the child live—thy child and mine, Morella’s.\n      But thy days shall be days of sorrow—that sorrow which is the most\n      lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees. For\n      the hours of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a\n      life, as the roses of Paestum twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer, then,\n      play the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine,\n      thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the\n      Moslemin at Mecca.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this?” but she turned away\n      her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs, she\n      thus died, and I heard her voice no more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had given\n      birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more, her child, a\n      daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in stature and intellect, and was\n      the perfect resemblance of her who had departed, and I loved her with a\n      love more fervent than I had believed it possible to feel for any denizen\n      of earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened, and\n      gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. I said the child\n      grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange, indeed, was her rapid\n      increase in bodily size—but terrible, oh! terrible were the tumultuous\n      thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development of her\n      mental being. Could it be otherwise, when I daily discovered in the\n      conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the woman?—when\n      the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and when the\n      wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from its full\n      and speculative eye? When, I say, all this became evident to my appalled\n      senses—when I could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw it off from\n      those perceptions which trembled to receive it—is it to be wondered at\n      that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my\n      spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and\n      thrilling theories of the entombed Morella? I snatched from the scrutiny\n      of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the\n      rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety over all\n      which concerned the beloved.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her holy, and\n      mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing form, day after day\n      did I discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother, the\n      melancholy and the dead. And hourly grew darker these shadows of\n      similitude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and\n      more hideously terrible in their aspect. For that her smile was like her\n      mother’s I could bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect\n      <i>identity</i>—that her eyes were like Morella’s I could\n      endure; but then they, too, often looked down into the depths of my soul\n      with Morella’s own intense and bewildering meaning. And in the\n      contour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and\n      in the wan fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad\n      musical tones of her speech, and above all—oh! above all—in the\n      phrases and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the\n      living, I found food for consuming thought and horror—for a worm that\n      <i>would</i> not die.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter remained\n      nameless upon the earth. “My child,” and “my love,” were the designations\n      usually prompted by a father’s affection, and the rigid seclusion of her\n      days precluded all other intercourse. Morella’s name died with her at her\n      death. Of the mother I had never spoken to the daughter;—it was impossible\n      to speak. Indeed, during the brief period of her existence, the latter had\n      received no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have\n      been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. But at length the\n      ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and agitated\n      condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my destiny. And at\n      the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. And many titles of the wise and\n      beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign lands, came\n      thronging to my lips, with many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the\n      happy, and the good. What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the\n      buried dead? What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its very\n      recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the\n      temples to the heart? What fiend spoke from the recesses of my soul, when\n      amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the night, I whispered within\n      the ears of the holy man the syllables—Morella? What more than fiend\n      convulsed the features of my child, and overspread them with hues of\n      death, as starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy\n      eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of\n      our ancestral vault, responded—“I am here!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds within my\n      ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain. Years—years\n      may pass away, but the memory of that epoch—never! Nor was I indeed\n      ignorant of the flowers and the vine—but the hemlock and the cypress\n      overshadowed me night and day. And I kept no reckoning of time or place,\n      and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew\n      dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them\n      all I beheld only—Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed but\n      one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore—Morella.\n      But she died; and with my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and I laughed\n      with a long and bitter laugh as I found no traces of the first in the\n      charnel where I laid the second, Morella.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.30\"></a>A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS</h2>\n<p>\n      During the fall of the year 1827, while residing near Charlottesville,\n      Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This\n      young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a\n      profound interest and curiosity. I found it impossible to comprehend him\n      either in his moral or his physical relations. Of his family I could\n      obtain no satisfactory account. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even\n      about his age—although I call him a young gentleman—there was\n      something which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed\n      young—and he made a point of speaking about his youth—yet\n      there were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining him\n      a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar than in his\n      personal appearance. He was singularly tall and thin. He stooped much. His\n      limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was broad and low.\n      His complexion was absolutely bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible,\n      and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever\n      before seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile, however,\n      was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no variation\n      whatever. It was one of profound melancholy—of a phaseless and\n      unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large, and round like those of a\n      cat. The pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of light, underwent\n      contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. In\n      moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost\n      inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected but of an\n      intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet their ordinary\n      condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to convey the idea of\n      the eyes of a long-interred corpse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and he\n      was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory, half\n      apologetic strain, which, when I first heard it, impressed me very\n      painfully. I soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore\n      off. It seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly to\n      assert that, physically, he had not always been what he was—that a\n      long series of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more\n      than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. For many years past he\n      had been attended by a physician, named Templeton—an old gentleman,\n      perhaps seventy years of age—whom he had first encountered at\n      Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received, or\n      fancied that he received, great benefit. The result was that Bedloe, who\n      was wealthy, had made an arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the\n      latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to\n      devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of the\n      invalid.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at Paris\n      had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of Mesmer. It was\n      altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in\n      alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this success had very\n      naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the\n      opinions from which the remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however,\n      like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his\n      pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer to\n      submit to numerous experiments. By a frequent repetition of these, a\n      result had arisen, which of late days has become so common as to attract\n      little or no attention, but which, at the period of which I write, had\n      very rarely been known in America. I mean to say, that between Doctor\n      Templeton and Bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct\n      and strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepared to\n      assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits of the\n      simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had attained great\n      intensity. At the first attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the\n      mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth or sixth he succeeded very\n      partially, and after long continued effort. Only at the twelfth was the\n      triumph complete. After this the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to\n      that of the physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the\n      two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere volition\n      of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of his presence. It is\n      only now, in the year 1845, when similar miracles are witnessed daily by\n      thousands, that I dare venture to record this apparent impossibility as a\n      matter of serious fact.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive, excitable,\n      enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous and creative; and no\n      doubt it derived additional force from the habitual use of morphine, which\n      he swallowed in great quantity, and without which he would have found it\n      impossible to exist. It was his practice to take a very large dose of it\n      immediately after breakfast each morning—or, rather, immediately\n      after a cup of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon—and\n      then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among\n      the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and southward of\n      Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the title of the Ragged\n      Mountains.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and during the\n      strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is termed the Indian\n      Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the hills. The day passed, and\n      still he did not return.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his\n      protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when he\n      unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual, and in\n      rather more than ordinary spirits. The account which he gave of his\n      expedition, and of the events which had detained him, was a singular one\n      indeed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the morning when\n      I left Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately to the mountains, and,\n      about ten, entered a gorge which was entirely new to me. I followed the\n      windings of this pass with much interest. The scenery which presented\n      itself on all sides, although scarcely entitled to be called grand, had\n      about it an indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary\n      desolation. The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could not help\n      believing that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod had\n      been trodden never before by the foot of a human being. So entirely\n      secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series of accidents,\n      is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means impossible that I\n      was indeed the first adventurer—the very first and sole adventurer\n      who had ever penetrated its recesses.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the Indian\n      Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no doubt, to\n      deepen the vague impressions which these objects created. So dense was\n      this pleasant fog that I could at no time see more than a dozen yards of\n      the path before me. This path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun\n      could not be seen, I soon lost all idea of the direction in which I\n      journeyed. In the meantime the morphine had its customary effect—that\n      of enduing all the external world with an intensity of interest. In the\n      quivering of a leaf—in the hue of a blade of grass—in the\n      shape of a trefoil—in the humming of a bee—in the gleaming of\n      a dew-drop—in the breathing of the wind—in the faint odors\n      that came from the forest—there came a whole universe of suggestion—a\n      gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the mist\n      deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I was reduced to\n      an absolute groping of the way. And now an indescribable uneasiness\n      possessed me—a species of nervous hesitation and tremor. I feared to\n      tread, lest I should be precipitated into some abyss. I remembered, too,\n      strange stories told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and\n      fierce races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns. A thousand\n      vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me—fancies the more\n      distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was arrested by the\n      loud beating of a drum.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was a thing\n      unknown. I could not have been more surprised at the sound of the trump of\n      the Archangel. But a new and still more astounding source of interest and\n      perplexity arose. There came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a\n      bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked\n      man rushed past me with a shriek. He came so close to my person that I\n      felt his hot breath upon my face. He bore in one hand an instrument\n      composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them vigorously as he\n      ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before, panting after him,\n      with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge beast. I could not\n      be mistaken in its character. It was a hyena.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my terrors—for\n      I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to arouse myself to waking\n      consciousness. I stepped boldly and briskly forward. I rubbed my eyes. I\n      called aloud. I pinched my limbs. A small spring of water presented itself\n      to my view, and here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck.\n      This seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto\n      annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and\n      complacently on my unknown way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain oppressive\n      closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a tree. Presently\n      there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of the\n      tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass. At this shadow I gazed\n      wonderingly for many minutes. Its character stupefied me with\n      astonishment. I looked upward. The tree was a palm.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation—for the\n      fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw—I felt that I\n      had perfect command of my senses—and these senses now brought to my\n      soul a world of novel and singular sensation. The heat became all at once\n      intolerable. A strange odor loaded the breeze. A low, continuous murmur,\n      like that arising from a full, but gently flowing river, came to my ears,\n      intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need not attempt\n      to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the incumbent fog as\n      if by the wand of an enchanter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down into a\n      vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the margin of this\n      river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian\n      Tales, but of a character even more singular than any there described.\n      From my position, which was far above the level of the town, I could\n      perceive its every nook and corner, as if delineated on a map. The streets\n      seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all directions,\n      but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and absolutely swarmed\n      with inhabitants. The houses were wildly picturesque. On every hand was a\n      wilderness of balconies, of verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and\n      fantastically carved oriels. Bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed\n      rich wares in infinite variety and profusion—silks, muslins, the\n      most dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides these\n      things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters with\n      stately dames close-veiled, elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols\n      grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded\n      maces. And amid the crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and\n      confusion—amid the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and\n      robed, and of flowing beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy\n      filleted bulls, while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered,\n      chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung to\n      the minarets and oriels. From the swarming streets to the banks of the\n      river, there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing\n      places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty\n      through the vast fleets of deeply-burthened ships that far and wide\n      encountered its surface. Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent\n      majestic groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird\n      trees of vast age; and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the\n      thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a\n      solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to\n      the banks of the magnificent river.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I saw—what\n      I heard—what I felt—what I thought—had about it nothing\n      of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously\n      self-consistent. At first, doubting that I was really awake, I entered\n      into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I really was. Now,\n      when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the suspicion\n      never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost immediately\n      aroused. Thus Novalis errs not in saying that ‘we are near waking when we\n      dream that we dream.’ Had the vision occurred to me as I describe it,\n      without my suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have\n      been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it was, I am\n      forced to class it among other phenomena.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed Dr. Templeton, “but\n      proceed. You arose and descended into the city.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of profound\n      astonishment “I arose, as you say, and descended into the city. On my way\n      I fell in with an immense populace, crowding through every avenue, all in\n      the same direction, and exhibiting in every action the wildest excitement.\n      Very suddenly, and by some inconceivable impulse, I became intensely\n      imbued with personal interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel that\n      I had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what it\n      was. Against the crowd which environed me, however, I experienced a deep\n      sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid them, and, swiftly, by a\n      circuitous path, reached and entered the city. Here all was the wildest\n      tumult and contention. A small party of men, clad in garments half Indian,\n      half European, and officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly British,\n      were engaged, at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the alleys. I\n      joined the weaker party, arming myself with the weapons of a fallen\n      officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the nervous ferocity of\n      despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to seek refuge in\n      a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded ourselves, and, for the present\n      were secure. From a loop-hole near the summit of the kiosk, I perceived a\n      vast crowd, in furious agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace\n      that overhung the river. Presently, from an upper window of this place,\n      there descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of\n      the turbans of his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he escaped to\n      the opposite bank of the river.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few hurried\n      but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining\n      over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic sally from the kiosk. We\n      rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreated, at first, before\n      us. They rallied, fought madly, and retreated again. In the mean time we\n      were borne far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among\n      the narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of which\n      the sun had never been able to shine. The rabble pressed impetuously upon\n      us, harrassing us with their spears, and overwhelming us with flights of\n      arrows. These latter were very remarkable, and resembled in some respects\n      the writhing creese of the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a\n      creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of\n      them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An instantaneous\n      and dreadful sickness seized me. I struggled—I gasped—I died.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n       “You will hardly persist <i>now</i>,” said I smiling,\n       “that the whole of your adventure was not a dream. You are not\n       prepared to maintain that you are dead?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally from\n      Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became\n      fearfully pallid, and remained silent. I looked toward Templeton. He sat\n      erect and rigid in his chair—his teeth chattered, and his eyes were\n      starting from their sockets. “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to\n      Bedloe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment—my sole\n      feeling—was that of darkness and nonentity, with the consciousness\n      of death. At length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock\n      through my soul, as if of electricity. With it came the sense of\n      elasticity and of light. This latter I felt—not saw. In an instant I\n      seemed to rise from the ground. But I had no bodily, no visible, audible,\n      or palpable presence. The crowd had departed. The tumult had ceased. The\n      city was in comparative repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow\n      in my temple, the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these\n      things I felt—not saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the corpse\n      seemed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had none, but\n      appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the\n      city, retracing the circuitous path by which I had entered it. When I had\n      attained that point of the ravine in the mountains at which I had\n      encountered the hyena, I again experienced a shock as of a galvanic\n      battery; the sense of weight, of volition, of substance, returned. I\n      became my original self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward—but the\n      past had not lost the vividness of the real—and not now, even for an\n      instant, can I compel my understanding to regard it as a dream.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet it would\n      be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed. Let us suppose\n      only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of some\n      stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content ourselves with this\n      supposition. For the rest I have some explanation to make. Here is a\n      watercolor drawing, which I should have shown you before, but which an\n      unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it of an\n      extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious. He\n      nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a miniature portrait—a\n      miraculously accurate one, to be sure—of his own very remarkable\n      features. At least this was my thought as I regarded it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture—it is\n      here, scarcely visible, in this corner—1780. In this year was the\n      portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend—a Mr. Oldeb—to\n      whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the administration of\n      Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years old. When I first saw you,\n      Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous similarity which existed\n      between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you, to seek\n      your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in\n      my becoming your constant companion. In accomplishing this point, I was\n      urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory of the\n      deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not altogether horrorless\n      curiosity respecting yourself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the\n      hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the Indian city of\n      Benares, upon the Holy River. The riots, the combat, the massacre, were\n      the actual events of the insurrection of Cheyte Sing, which took place in\n      1780, when Hastings was put in imminent peril of his life. The man\n      escaping by the string of turbans was Cheyte Sing himself. The party in\n      the kiosk were sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings. Of this\n      party I was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally\n      of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a\n      Bengalee. That officer was my dearest friend. It was Oldeb. You will\n      perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the speaker produced a note-book in\n      which several pages appeared to have been freshly written,) “that at the\n      very period in which you fancied these things amid the hills, I was\n      engaged in detailing them upon paper here at home.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs appeared\n      in a Charlottesville paper:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus Bedlo, a\n      gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have long endeared him to\n      the citizens of Charlottesville.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which has\n      often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded only as\n      the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate cause was one of especial\n      singularity. In an excursion to the Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a\n      slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with great determination\n      of blood to the head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical\n      bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In a fearfully brief period\n      the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar containing the leeches,\n      had been introduced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular sangsues\n      which are now and then found in the neighboring ponds. This creature\n      fastened itself upon a small artery in the right temple. Its close\n      resemblance to the medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked\n      until too late.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “N. B.—The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be\n      distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and especially by\n      its writhing or vermicular motions, which very nearly resemble those of a\n      snake.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the topic of\n      this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how it happened\n      that the name of the deceased had been given as Bedlo.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I presume,” I said, “you have authority for this spelling, but I have\n      always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Authority?—no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error. The\n      name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew it to be\n      spelt otherwise in my life.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, “then indeed has it\n      come to pass that one truth is stranger than any fiction—for Bedloe,\n      without the e, what is it but Oldeb conversed! And this man tells me that\n      it is a typographical error.”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.31\"></a>THE SPECTACLES</h2>\n<p>\n      Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love at first\n      sight;” but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply, have\n      always advocated its existence. Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may be\n      termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the\n      most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human\n      affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy—in\n      a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are\n      those which are riveted by a glance. The confession I am about to make\n      will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth\n      of the position.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My story requires that I should be somewhat minute. I am still a very\n      young man—not yet twenty-two years of age. My name, at present, is a\n      very usual and rather plebeian one—Simpson. I say “at present;” for\n      it is only lately that I have been so called—having legislatively\n      adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large\n      inheritance left me by a distant male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq. The\n      bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator,—the\n      family, not the Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte—or,\n      more properly, these are my first and middle appellations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true patronym,\n      Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride—believing that I could\n      trace a descent from the immortal author of the “Chronicles.” While on the\n      subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singular coincidence of\n      sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors. My father\n      was a Monsieur Froissart, of Paris. His wife—my mother, whom he\n      married at fifteen—was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of\n      Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when married,\n      was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur Voissart, very\n      singularly, had married a lady of similar name—a Mademoiselle\n      Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when married; and her mother, also,\n      Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led to the altar. These early\n      marriages are usual in France. Here, however, are Moissart, Voissart,\n      Croissart, and Froissart, all in the direct line of descent. My own name,\n      though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much\n      repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about\n      accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. On the contrary, I\n      believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world\n      would call a handsome face. In height I am five feet eleven. My hair is\n      black and curling. My nose is sufficiently good. My eyes are large and\n      gray; and although, in fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree,\n      still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance.\n      The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have\n      resorted to every remedy—short of wearing glasses. Being youthful\n      and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused\n      to employ them. I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the\n      countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air\n      of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age. An\n      eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and\n      affectation. I have hitherto managed as well as I could without either.\n      But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all,\n      are of little importance. I will content myself with saying, in addition,\n      that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and that\n      all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One night last winter I entered a box at the P—— Theatre, in company\n      with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was an opera night, and the bills presented\n      a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded. We were\n      in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for\n      us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided\n      attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing\n      the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the\n      city. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was about turning my eyes\n      to the prima donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one\n      of the private boxes which had escaped my observation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion with\n      which I regarded this figure. It was that of a female, the most exquisite\n      I had ever beheld. The face was so far turned toward the stage that, for\n      some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it—but the form was\n      divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion—and\n      even the term “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necromancy of female\n      gracefulness—was always a power which I had found it impossible to\n      resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my\n      wildest and most enthusiastic visions. The figure, almost all of which the\n      construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the\n      medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the\n      majestic. Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. The head, of\n      which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek\n      Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of <i>gaze\n      äérienne</i>, which put me in mind of the <i>ventum textilem</i> of Apuleius. The\n      right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of\n      my frame with its exquisite symmetry. Its upper portion was draperied by\n      one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion. This extended but little\n      below the elbow. Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material,\n      close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell\n      gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers,\n      upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of\n      extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off\n      by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and\n      clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels—telling, in words that could\n      not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I had\n      been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt the full\n      force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning “love at\n      first sight.” My feelings were totally different from any which I had\n      hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated\n      specimens of female loveliness. An unaccountable, and what I am compelled\n      to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not\n      only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the\n      admirable object before me. I saw—I felt—I knew that I was\n      deeply, madly, irrevocably in love—and this even before seeing the\n      face of the person beloved. So intense, indeed, was the passion that\n      consumed me, that I really believe it would have received little if any\n      abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary\n      character; so anomalous is the nature of the only true love—of the\n      love at first sight—and so little really dependent is it upon the\n      external conditions which only seem to create and control it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden\n      disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially\n      toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face. Its beauty\n      even exceeded my anticipations—and yet there was something about it\n      which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was. I\n      said “disappointed,” but this is not altogether the word. My sentiments\n      were at once quieted and exalted. They partook less of transport and more\n      of calm enthusiasm—of enthusiastic repose. This state of feeling arose,\n      perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet I at\n      once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this. There\n      was something else—some mystery which I could not develope—some\n      expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it\n      greatly heightened my interest. In fact, I was just in that condition of\n      mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of\n      extravagance. Had the lady been alone, I should undoubtedly have entered\n      her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was\n      attended by two companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful\n      woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain,\n      hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at all\n      events, a more distinct view of her beauty. I would have removed my\n      position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre\n      rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of Fashion had, of late,\n      imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this,\n      even had I been so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not—and\n      was thus in despair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Talbot,” I said, “you have an opera-glass. Let me have it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “An opera-glass!—no!—what do you suppose I would be\n      doing with an opera-glass?” Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen to me\n      will you? Do you see the stage-box?—there!—no, the next.— Did\n      you ever behold as lovely a woman?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I wonder who she can be?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she is? ‘Not\n      to know her argues yourself unknown.’ She is the celebrated Madame Lalande—the\n      beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the whole town.\n      Immensely wealthy too—a widow, and a great match—has just\n      arrived from Paris.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Do you know her?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes; I have the honor.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Will you introduce me?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B—’s.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot’s advice; for he\n      remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and\n      occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was\n      transacting upon the stage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length\n      had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face. It was\n      exquisitely lovely—this, of course, my heart had told me before,\n      even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point—but still the\n      unintelligible something disturbed me. I finally concluded that my senses\n      were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more\n      properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness\n      of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and\n      majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment,\n      with an interest tenfold.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great\n      trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady,\n      that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze. Still, I\n      was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant.\n      She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled contour of\n      the back portion of the head. After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity\n      to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around\n      and again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark eyes fell instantly,\n      and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my astonishment at\n      perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but\n      that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass—elevated it—adjusted\n      it—and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for\n      the space of several minutes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more thoroughly\n      astounded—astounded only—not offended or disgusted in the\n      slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have\n      been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole thing was done with so\n      much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much repose—with so\n      evident an air of the highest breeding, in short—that nothing of\n      mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of\n      admiration and surprise.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed\n      satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing\n      the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it,\n      and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of\n      several minutes—for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general\n      observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the\n      audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no\n      visible effect upon the countenance of Madame Lalande.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was—she dropped the\n      glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now\n      being turned toward myself, as before. I continued to watch her\n      unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing.\n      Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon\n      I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage\n      was, in fact, attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what\n      effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my\n      excitable mind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair\n      object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while\n      she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation\n      had reference to myself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the stage, and,\n      for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance. At the expiration\n      of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by\n      seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her\n      side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of\n      the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous\n      composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of\n      excitement—into an absolute delirium of love—served rather to\n      embolden than to disconcert me. In the mad intensity of my devotion, I\n      forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the\n      vision which confronted my gaze. Watching my opportunity, when I thought\n      the audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the\n      eyes of Madame Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but\n      unmistakable bow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then slowly and\n      cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been\n      noticed—then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and\n      expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols\n      upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain. I was\n      greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand\n      the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking; but the reader may form some\n      feeble conception of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—my\n      delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, instantly afterward,\n      having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set\n      fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a\n      bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and\n      unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my transport—upon\n      my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was mad with excess of\n      happiness, it was myself at that moment. I loved. This was my first love—so\n      I felt it to be. It was love supreme—indescribable. It was “love at first\n      sight;” and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an instant. What other\n      construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady\n      so beautiful—so wealthy—evidently so accomplished—of so\n      high breeding—of so lofty a position in society—in every\n      regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured was Madame Lalande? Yes,\n      she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an\n      enthusiasm as blind—as uncompromising—as uncalculating—as\n      abandoned—and as utterly unbounded as my own! These delicious\n      fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of\n      the drop-curtain. The audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately\n      supervened. Quitting Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way\n      into closer proximity with Madame Lalande. Having failed in this, on\n      account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps\n      homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able\n      to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be\n      introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the morrow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long\n      and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until “one” were\n      snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even Stamboul, it is said, shall\n      have an end, and there came an end to this long delay. The clock struck.\n      As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B——’s and inquired for\n      Talbot.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—“let me tell\n      you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and\n      impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out. What do you mean?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all. He rode over to S——,\n      immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in town\n      again for a week.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored to reply, but my\n      tongue refused its office. At length I turned on my heel, livid with\n      wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the Talbots to the\n      innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that my considerate friend, il\n      fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself—had\n      forgotten it as soon as it was made. At no time was he a very scrupulous\n      man of his word. There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as\n      well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile\n      inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met. By report\n      she was known, I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had\n      been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who\n      claimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still comparatively\n      strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me\n      through the formality of a morning call. While I stood thus in despair,\n      conversing with a trio of friends upon the all-absorbing subject of my\n      heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As I live, there she is!” cried one.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly down\n      the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by the\n      younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my trio who\n      had spoken first.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air, but art\n      will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she did at Paris five\n      years ago. A beautiful woman still;—don’t you think so, Froissart?—Simpson,\n      I mean.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Still!</i>” said I, “and why shouldn’t she\n      be? But compared with her friend she is as a rush-light to the evening\n      star—a glow-worm to Antares.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making\n      discoveries—original ones, I mean.” And here we separated, while one\n      of the trio began humming a gay <i>vaudeville</i>, of which I caught only the\n      lines—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Ninon, Ninon, Ninon à bas—<br>\n      A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to console\n      me, although it fed the passion by which I was consumed. As the carriage\n      of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized\n      me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all\n      imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such\n      time as Talbot should think proper to return from the country. In the\n      meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public\n      amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had\n      the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once\n      again. This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every\n      day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and every day\n      had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting “Not come home\n      yet” of his footman.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little short\n      of madness. Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a Parisian—had\n      lately arrived from Paris—might she not suddenly return?—return\n      before Talbot came back—and might she not be thus lost to me\n      forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since my future happiness\n      was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision. In a word, upon the\n      breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the\n      address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in\n      which I poured out my whole heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion. I concealed\n      nothing—nothing even of my weakness. I alluded to the romantic\n      circumstances of our first meeting—even to the glances which had\n      passed between us. I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her\n      love; while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as\n      two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct. As a third, I spoke of\n      my fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity\n      of a formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle\n      ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances—of\n      my affluence—and with an offer of my heart and of my hand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After what seemed the\n      lapse of a century it came.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear, I really received a\n      letter from Madame Lalande—the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized\n      Madame Lalande. Her eyes—her magnificent eyes, had not belied her\n      noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank\n      dictates of her reason—the generous impulses of her nature—despising\n      the conventional pruderies of the world. She had not scorned my proposals.\n      She had not sheltered herself in silence. She had not returned my letter\n      unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite\n      fingers. It ran thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n      “Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of\n      his contrée so vell as might. It is only de late dat I am arrive, and not\n      yet ave do opportunité for to—l’étudier.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Vid dis apologie for the manière, I vill now say dat, hélas!—Monsieur\n      Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de more? Hélas! am I not\n      ready speak de too moshe?\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      “E<small>UGENIE</small> L<small>ALAND</small>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed, no\n      doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now\n      escaped my memory. Still Talbot <i>would</i> not return. Alas! could he\n      have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had\n      occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown\n      immediately to my relief? Still, however, he came <i>not</i>. I wrote. He\n      replied. He was detained by urgent business—but would shortly\n      return. He begged me not to be impatient—to moderate my\n      transports—to read soothing books—to drink nothing stronger\n      than Hock—and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid.\n      The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing\n      rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation? I wrote\n      him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith. My letter was\n      returned by <i>that</i> footman, with the following endorsement in\n      pencil. The scoundrel had joined his master in the country:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Left S—— yesterday, for parts unknown—did not\n      say where—or when be back—so thought best to return letter,\n      knowing your handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a\n      hurry.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yours sincerely,\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “STUBBS.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal deities\n      both master and valet:—but there was little use in anger, and no\n      consolation at all in complaint.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity. Hitherto it\n      had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end.\n      Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of\n      mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded\n      as indecorous by Madame Lalande? Since the affair of the letter, I had\n      been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about\n      twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in\n      livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. Here, amid the\n      luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer\n      evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the\n      assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a presence of mind\n      truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the\n      most bewitchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into the rear,\n      and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and\n      unreservedly of our love.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it, our\n      conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet tongue, so adapted\n      to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and,\n      with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to consent to an\n      immediate marriage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of decorum—that\n      bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss\n      has forever gone by. I had most imprudently made it known among my\n      friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance—thus that I\n      did not possess it—thus, again, there was no possibility of\n      concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other. And then she\n      adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date. To wed\n      immediately would be improper—would be indecorous—would be\n      outre. All this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured\n      while it grieved and convinced me. She went even so far as to accuse me,\n      laughingly, of rashness—of imprudence. She bade me remember that I\n      really even knew not who she was—what were her prospects, her\n      connections, her standing in society. She begged me, but with a sigh, to\n      reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation—a will o’\n      the wisp—a fancy or fantasy of the moment—a baseless and\n      unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart. These\n      things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly\n      and more darkly around us—and then, with a gentle pressure of her\n      fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the\n      argumentative fabric she had reared.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can. I spoke at\n      length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion—of her\n      exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In conclusion, I\n      dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course\n      of love—that course of true love that never did run smooth—and\n      thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily\n      long.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her\n      determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said,\n      which she felt assured I had not properly considered. This was a delicate\n      point—for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw\n      that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every\n      sacrifice should be made. She alluded to the topic of age. Was I aware—was\n      I fully aware of the discrepancy between us? That the age of the husband,\n      should surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty—the\n      age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as\n      even proper; but she had always entertained the belief that the years of\n      the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband. A discrepancy\n      of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas! to a life of\n      unhappiness. Now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and\n      twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of\n      my Eugénie extended very considerably beyond that sum.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of candor—which\n      delighted—which enchanted me—which eternally riveted my\n      chains. I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed\n      me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My sweetest Eugénie,” I cried, “what is all this about which you are\n      discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But what then? The\n      customs of the world are so many conventional follies. To those who love\n      as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour? I am\n      twenty-two, you say; granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once,\n      twenty-three. Now you yourself, my dearest Eugénie, can have numbered no\n      more than—can have numbered no more than—no more than—than—than—than—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame Lalande would\n      interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a Frenchwoman is seldom\n      direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query, some\n      little practical reply of her own. In the present instance, Eugénie, who\n      for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her\n      bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately\n      picked up and presented to her.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “Keep it for\n      my sake—for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents.\n      Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very\n      information you seem to desire. It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark—but\n      you can examine it at your leisure in the morning. In the meantime, you\n      shall be my escort home to-night. My friends are about holding a little\n      musical <i>levée</i>. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We French are\n      not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall have no difficulty\n      in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. The mansion was quite\n      a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of this latter point,\n      however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we\n      arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during\n      the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant\n      period of the day. In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single\n      shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this\n      apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even\n      splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company\n      chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable\n      shadow. This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a\n      choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could\n      not do better than immediately adopt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life.\n      Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and\n      the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private circle\n      out of Vienna. The instrumental performers were many and of superior\n      talents. The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less\n      than well. At length, upon a peremptory call for “Madame Lalande,” she\n      arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon\n      which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and\n      her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main\n      drawing-room. I would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the\n      circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had better remain\n      unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing,\n      although not of hearing, her sing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical—but the\n      effect upon myself was something even more. I know not how adequately to\n      describe it. It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with\n      which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme\n      sensibility of the singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either\n      air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her\n      utterance of the romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave the\n      words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti—is ringing in my memory yet.\n      Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice embraced three\n      complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano,\n      and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed,\n      with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal\n      composition—ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In\n      the final of the Somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect at\n      the words:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Ah! non guinge uman pensiero<br>\n     Al contento ond ’io son piena.\n</p>\n<p>\n      Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of\n      Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid\n      transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an\n      interval of two octaves.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she\n      resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the\n      deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance. Of my surprise I said\n      nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain\n      feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary\n      conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would\n      not acquit herself with any remarkable ability.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally\n      unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life,\n      and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative. I\n      concealed nothing—felt that I had a right to conceal nothing—from\n      her confiding affection. Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point\n      of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of\n      my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of\n      those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much\n      higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love. I\n      touched upon my college indiscretions—upon my extravagances—upon\n      my carousals—upon my debts—upon my flirtations. I even went so\n      far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had\n      been troubled—of a chronic rheumatism—of a twinge of\n      hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and\n      inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly,\n      “you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for,\n      without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would have\n      accused you of the crime. By the by,” she continued, “have\n      you any recollection—” and here I fancied that a blush, even\n      through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her\n      cheek—“have you any recollection, <i>mon cher ami</i>, of\n      this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass\n      which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Full well—alas! do I remember it,” I exclaimed, pressing\n      passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my\n      inspection. They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and\n      filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I\n      could not help perceiving were of high value.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Eh bien! mon ami</i>,” she resumed with a certain <i>empressment</i> of manner that\n      rather surprised me—“<i>Eh bien! mon ami</i>, you have earnestly besought\n      of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. You\n      have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. Should I yield to your\n      entreaties—and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom—would\n      I not be entitled to demand of you a very—a very little boon in\n      return?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the\n      observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from\n      throwing myself impetuously at her feet. “Name it, my beloved, my Eugénie,\n      my own!—name it!—but, alas! it is already yielded ere named.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You shall conquer, then, <i>mon ami</i>,” said she, “for the sake of the Eugénie\n      whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed—this\n      weakness more moral than physical—and which, let me assure you, is\n      so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature—so inconsistent with\n      the candor of your usual character—and which, if permitted further\n      control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very\n      disagreeable scrape. You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation\n      which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied\n      denial of your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you virtually\n      deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. You will\n      understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear spectacles;—ah,\n      hush!—you have already consented to wear them, for my sake. You\n      shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and which, though\n      admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a\n      gem. You perceive that, by a trifling modification thus—or thus—it\n      can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the\n      waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass. It is in the former mode, however, and\n      habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This request—must I confess it?—confused me in no little\n      degree. But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation,\n      of course, a matter altogether out of the question.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is done!” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at the\n      moment. “It is done—it is most cheerfully agreed. I sacrifice every\n      feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an\n      eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning\n      which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it upon my—upon\n      my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and\n      less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you\n      desire.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the\n      morrow. Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town. I\n      was to see him at once, and procure a carriage. The <i>soirée</i> would\n      scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at\n      the door; when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the\n      company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to call\n      at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married,\n      drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East; leaving the\n      fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it\n      thought best.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of\n      Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel,\n      for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the\n      powerful aid of the glasses. The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful\n      one! Those large luminous eyes!—that proud Grecian nose!—those\n      dark luxuriant curls!—“Ah!” said I, exultingly to myself, “this is\n      indeed the speaking image of my beloved!” I turned the reverse, and\n      discovered the words—“Eugénie Lalande—aged twenty-seven years\n      and seven months.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good\n      fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated\n      me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power. In a word,\n      we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning,\n      just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage\n      with Madame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and\n      driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction northeast by north,\n      half-north.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be up all\n      night, we should make our first stop at C——, a village about twenty\n      miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose,\n      before proceeding upon our route. At four precisely, therefore, the\n      carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. I handed my adored wife\n      out, and ordered breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown into a\n      small parlor, and sat down.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed, enraptured,\n      at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my\n      head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance\n      with the celebrated loveliness of Madame Lalande, that I had enjoyed a\n      near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And now, <i>mon ami</i>,” said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this\n      train of reflection, “and now, <i>mon cher ami</i>, since we are indissolubly one—since\n      I have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of\n      our agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a\n      little favor to bestow—a little promise which it is your intention\n      to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full easily do I call to\n      mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to Eugénie last night.\n      Listen! You spoke thus: ‘It is done!—it is most cheerfully agreed! I\n      sacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass\n      as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that\n      morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it\n      upon my—upon my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the\n      less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more\n      serviceable, form which you desire.’ These were the exact words, my\n      beloved husband, were they not?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “They were,” I said; “you have an excellent memory; and assuredly, my\n      beautiful Eugénie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the\n      performance of the trivial promise they imply. See! Behold! they are\n      becoming—rather—are they not?” And here, having arranged the\n      glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them gingerly in\n      their proper position; while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and\n      folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and\n      prim, and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Goodness gracious me!” I exclaimed, almost at the very instant that the\n      rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose—“<i>My!</i> goodness gracious\n      me!—why, what can be the matter with these glasses?” and taking them\n      quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted\n      them again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which\n      occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became elevated into\n      astonishment; and this astonishment was profound—was\n      extreme—indeed I may say it was horrific. What, in the name of\n      everything hideous, did this mean? Could I believe my eyes?—could\n      I?—that was the question. Was that—was that—was that\n      rouge? And were those—and were those—were those wrinkles,\n      upon the visage of Eugénie Lalande? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of the\n      gods and goddesses, little and\n      big!—what—what—what—<i>what</i> had become of her\n      teeth? I dashed the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to\n      my feet, stood erect in the middle of the floor, confronting Mrs.\n      Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the\n      same time, utterly speechless with terror and with rage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now I have already said that Madame Eugénie Lalande—that is to say,\n      Simpson—spoke the English language but very little better than she\n      wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak\n      it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will carry a lady to any extreme; and\n      in the present care it carried Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary\n      extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not\n      altogether understand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent\n      astonishment, for some moments—“Vell, Monsieur?—and vat den?—vat\n      de matter now? Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave? If not like\n      me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“you—you—you\n      villainous old hag!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all! Me not one single day\n      more dan de eighty-doo.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Eighty-two!” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—“eighty-two\n      hundred thousand baboons! The miniature said twenty-seven years and seven\n      months!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true! but den de portraite has\n      been take for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go marry my segonde usbande,\n      Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my daughter by\n      my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Moissart!” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, Moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to speak the\n      truth, was none of the best,—“and vat den? Vat you know about de\n      Moissart?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him at all; only I\n      had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name? ’Tis ver\n      <i>goot</i> name; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot name too. My\n      daughter, Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur\n      Voissart,—and de name is bot <i>ver</i> respectable name.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Moissart?” I exclaimed, “and Voissart! Why, what is it you mean?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Vat I mean?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of dat,\n      I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I only tink proper to mean it. My\n      daughter’s daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she marry von Monsieur\n      Croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande daughter, Mademoiselle\n      Croissart, she marry von Monsieur Froissart; and I suppose you say dat <i>dat</i>\n      is not von <i>ver</i> respectaable name.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t say\n      Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and stretching out\n      her lower limbs at great length; “yes, Moissart, and Voissart, and\n      Croissart, and Froissart. But Monsieur Froissart, he vas von <i>ver</i> big vat\n      you call fool—he vas von ver great big donce like yourself—for\n      he lef <i>la belle France</i> for come to dis stupide Amérique—and ven he\n      get here he went and ave von <i>ver</i> stupid, von <i>ver, ver</i> stupide sonn, so I\n      hear, dough I not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him—neither me\n      nor my companion, de Madame Stéphanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon\n      Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat <i>dat</i>, too, is not von ver\n      respectable name.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working\n      up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made\n      an end of it, with great labor, she jumped up from her chair like somebody\n      bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she\n      jumped. Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms,\n      rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the\n      performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig\n      of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she\n      dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and danced a\n      fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated. “Moissart and\n      Voissart!” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings,\n      and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she completed another—“Moissart\n      and Voissart and Croissart and Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!—why,\n      you ineffable old serpent, that’s me—that’s me—d’ye hear?\n      that’s me”—here I screamed at the top of my voice—“that’s\n      me-e-e! I am Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart! and if I havn’t married my\n      great, great, grandmother, I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Madame Eugénie Lalande, <i>quasi</i> Simpson—formerly Moissart—was,\n      in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had been\n      beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the\n      sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her\n      girlhood. By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair,\n      false teeth, and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes\n      of Paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties\n      <i>en peu passées</i> of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed, she\n      might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated\n      Ninon De L’Enclos.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow\n      without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America, and\n      for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States,\n      in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second\n      husband’s—a Madame Stéphanie Lalande.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was arrested by my\n      notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with\n      a certain family resemblance to herself. Thus interested, and knowing that\n      the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her\n      party respecting me. The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and\n      told her who I was. The information thus obtained induced her to renew her\n      scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that I behaved\n      in the absurd manner already detailed. She returned my bow, however, under\n      the impression that, by some odd accident, I had discovered her identity.\n      When, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in\n      respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so\n      enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant the\n      younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect\n      truth, that she was “the celebrated widow, Madame Lalande.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered\n      Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very naturally\n      turned upon myself. My deficiencies of vision were then explained; for\n      these were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety,\n      and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had\n      been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had been\n      merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a theatre, to an\n      old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this imprudence, she\n      concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept out of my way to avoid\n      giving me the introduction. My street inquiries about “the lovely widow,\n      Madame Lalande,” were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course,\n      and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered\n      shortly after leaving Talbot’s hotel will be easily explained, as also\n      their allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had no opportunity of seeing Madame\n      Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her musical <i>soirée</i>, my silly\n      weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from\n      making a discovery of her age. When “Madame Lalande” was called upon to\n      sing, the younger lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the\n      call; my great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at\n      the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main\n      drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had been her\n      design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I was; but my own\n      prudential views rendered this unnecessary. The songs which I so much\n      admired, and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress,\n      were executed by Madame Stéphanie Lalande. The eyeglass was presented by\n      way of adding a reproof to the hoax—a sting to the epigram of the\n      deception. Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon\n      affectation with which I was so especially edified. It is almost\n      superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old\n      lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years.\n      They suited me, in fact, to a T.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon\n      companion of Talbot’s, and no priest. He was an excellent “whip,” however;\n      and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove the hack\n      which conveyed the “happy couple” out of town. Talbot took a seat at his\n      side. The two scoundrels were thus “in at the death,” and through a\n      half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in\n      grinning at the <i>dénouement</i> of the drama. I believe I shall be forced to\n      call them both out.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Nevertheless, I am <i>not</i> the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and\n      this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief;—but I <i>am</i> the\n      husband of Madame Lalande—of Madame Stéphanie Lalande—with\n      whom my good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies—if\n      she ever does—has been at the trouble of concocting me a match. In\n      conclusion: I am done forever with <i>billets doux</i>, and am never to be met\n      without <small>SPECTACLES</small>.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.32\"></a>KING PEST</h2>\n<h3>\n      A Tale Containing an Allegory.\n    </h3>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n     The gods do bear and will allow in kings<br>\n     The things which they abhor in rascal routes.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—<i>Buckhurst’s Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      About twelve o’clock, one night in the month of October, and during the\n      chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen belonging to the crew of\n      the <i>&gt;Free and Easy</i>, a trading schooner plying between Sluys and the\n      Thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much astonished to find\n      themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St.\n      Andrews, London—which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a\n      “Jolly Tar.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched, and in\n      every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at\n      the period—was, nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups\n      scattered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted to its\n      purpose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most interesting, if\n      not the most conspicuous.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion addressed by\n      the characteristic appellation of “Legs,” was at the same time much the\n      taller of the two. He might have measured six feet and a half, and an\n      habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary\n      consequence of an altitude so enormous. Superfluities in height\n      were, however, more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects.\n      He was exceedingly thin; and might, as his associates asserted, have\n      answered, when drunk, for a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have\n      served for a jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar nature,\n      had evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory\n      muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large hawk-nose, retreating\n      chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white eyes, the expression of\n      his countenance, although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to\n      matters and things in general, was not the less utterly solemn and serious\n      beyond all attempts at imitation or description.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse of his\n      companion. His stature could not have exceeded four feet. A pair of stumpy\n      bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his unusually short\n      and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their extremities, swung off\n      dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no\n      particular color, twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried\n      in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and\n      his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air\n      of complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner’s habit of\n      licking them at intervals. He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a\n      feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his\n      face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the worthy\n      couple in and about the different tap-houses of the neighbourhood during\n      the earlier hours of the night. Funds even the most ample, are not always\n      everlasting: and it was with empty pockets our friends had ventured upon\n      the present hostelrie.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the precise period, then, when this history properly commences, Legs,\n      and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with both elbows resting upon the\n      large oaken table in the middle of the floor, and with a hand upon either\n      cheek. They were eyeing, from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for\n      “humming-stuff,” the portentous words, “No Chalk,” which to their\n      indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that\n      very mineral whose presence they purported to deny. Not that the gift of\n      decyphering written characters—a gift among the commonalty of that\n      day considered little less cabalistical than the art of inditing—could,\n      in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of either disciple of the\n      sea; but there was, to say the truth, a certain twist in the formation of\n      the letters—an indescribable lee-lurch about the whole—which\n      foreboded, in the opinion of both seamen, a long run of dirty weather; and\n      determined them at once, in the allegorical words of Legs himself, to\n      “pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud before the wind.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and looped up the\n      points of their short doublets, they finally made a bolt for the street.\n      Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place, mistaking it for the\n      door, yet their escape was at length happily effected—and half after\n      twelve o’clock found our heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life\n      down a dark alley in the direction of St. Andrew’s Stair, hotly pursued by\n      the landlady of the “Jolly Tar.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many years\n      before and after, all England, but more especially the metropolis,\n      resounded with the fearful cry of “Plague!” The city was in a great\n      measure depopulated—and in those horrible regions, in the vicinity\n      of the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and filthy lanes and alleys,\n      the Demon of Disease was supposed to have had his nativity, Awe, Terror,\n      and Superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban, and all\n      persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon their dismal\n      solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers\n      erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that\n      loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed the\n      wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the\n      unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of\n      nightly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work, which\n      could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening of the\n      barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved but slender\n      protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which, in\n      consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous\n      dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust, during\n      the period of exile, to so insufficient a security.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed these\n      doings to the agency of human hands. Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and\n      fever-demons, were the popular imps of mischief; and tales so\n      blood-chilling were hourly told, that the whole mass of forbidden\n      buildings was, at length, enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and the\n      plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own\n      depreciations had created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited\n      district to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and which\n      indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that, in scrambling\n      down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin found their progress\n      suddenly impeded. To return was out of the question, and no time was to be\n      lost, as their pursuers were close upon their heels. With thorough-bred\n      seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and,\n      maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped\n      unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their drunken\n      course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in its noisome and\n      intricate recesses.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their reeling\n      footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation. The\n      air was cold and misty. The paving-stones, loosened from their beds, lay\n      in wild disorder amid the tall, rank grass, which sprang up around the\n      feet and ankles. Fallen houses choked up the streets. The most fetid and\n      poisonous smells everywhere prevailed;—and by the aid of that\n      ghastly light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a\n      vapory and pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the\n      by-paths and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass\n      of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the\n      very perpetration of his robbery.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or impediments such\n      as these, to stay the course of men who, naturally brave, and at that\n      time especially, brimful of courage and of “humming-stuff,”\n      would have reeled, as straight as their condition might have permitted,\n      undauntedly into the very jaws of Death. Onward—still onward\n      stalked the grim Legs, making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo\n      with yells like the terrific war-whoop of the Indian; and onward, still\n      onward rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more\n      active companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous\n      exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings <i>in basso</i>,\n      from the profundity of his stentorian lungs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence. Their\n      way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible—the\n      paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones and beams falling\n      momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their\n      sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses;\n      and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through\n      frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell\n      upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and\n      ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from the throat\n      of the excited Legs, was replied to from within, in a rapid succession of\n      wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks. Nothing daunted at sounds\n      which, of such a nature, at such a time, and in such a place, might have\n      curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken\n      couple rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered into\n      the midst of things with a volley of curses.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of an\n      undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor near the\n      entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths the\n      occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored with\n      their appropriate contents. In the middle of the room stood a table—in\n      the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch.\n      Bottles of various wines and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and\n      flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the\n      board. Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six. This\n      company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his companions, sat a\n      personage who appeared to be the president of the table. His stature was\n      gaunt and tall, and Legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more\n      emaciated than himself. His face was as yellow as saffron—but no\n      feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular\n      description. This one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously\n      lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh superadded\n      upon the natural head. His mouth was puckered and dimpled into an\n      expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as indeed the eyes of all\n      at table, were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication. This gentleman\n      was clothed from head to foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet\n      pall, wrapped negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish\n      cloak. His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he\n      nodded to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand,\n      he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have been just\n      knocking down some member of the company for a song.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the\n      less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as the person just\n      described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation. She\n      was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled\n      nearly that of the huge puncheon of October beer which stood, with the\n      head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face\n      was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather\n      want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before\n      mentioned in the case of the president—that is to say, only one\n      feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate\n      characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately observed that the\n      same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party;\n      every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion\n      of physiognomy. With the lady in question this portion proved to be the\n      mouth. Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to the\n      left—the short pendants which she wore in either auricle continually\n      bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every exertion to keep her\n      mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a newly starched\n      and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle\n      of cambric muslin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to\n      patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of her wasted\n      fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot which\n      tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indications of a\n      galloping consumption. An air of extreme <i>haut ton</i>, however, pervaded\n      her whole appearance; she wore in a graceful and <i>dégagé</i> manner, a large\n      and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in\n      ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose,\n      extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down far below\n      her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which she now and\n      then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue, gave to her\n      countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was seated a\n      little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the\n      shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders of Oporto wine. With his\n      arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table, he seemed\n      to think himself entitled to some consideration. He evidently prided\n      himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but took more\n      especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. This,\n      to say the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to fit\n      him exceedingly well—being fashioned from one of the curiously\n      embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons\n      which, in England and elsewhere, are customarily hung up, in some\n      conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a gentleman in\n      long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook, in a ridiculous\n      manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called “the horrors.” His jaws, which\n      had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a bandage of muslin; and\n      his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists, prevented him\n      from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the table; a\n      precaution rendered necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly\n      sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage. A pair of prodigious ears,\n      nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine, towered\n      away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were occasionally pricked\n      up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of a cork.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly stiff-looking\n      personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must, to speak seriously,\n      have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating habiliments. He was\n      habited, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome mahogany coffin. Its top\n      or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it\n      in the fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of\n      indescribable interest. Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for the sake\n      not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, nevertheless,\n      prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates; and as\n      he lay reclining against his tressel, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a\n      pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the ceiling\n      in absolute amazement at their own enormity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used as a\n      drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by means of a rope\n      tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling. The\n      other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck off from the body at right\n      angles, causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and twirl\n      about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found its way\n      into the apartment. In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of\n      ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire\n      scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an\n      undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows,\n      preventing any ray from escaping into the street.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more\n      extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct themselves\n      with that degree of decorum which might have been expected. Legs, leaning\n      against the wall near which he happened to be standing, dropped his lower\n      jaw still lower than usual, and spread open his eyes to their fullest\n      extent: while Hugh Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a\n      level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst\n      into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and immoderate\n      laughter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude, the\n      tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders—nodded to\n      them in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes—and,\n      arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some others of\n      the company had placed in the meantime for his accommodation. Legs to all\n      this offered not the slightest resistance, but sat down as he was\n      directed; while the gallant Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its\n      station near the head of the table, to the vicinity of the little\n      consumptive lady in the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high\n      glee, and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better\n      acquaintance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin\n      seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might have ensued,\n      had not the president, rapping upon the table with his truncheon, diverted\n      the attention of all present to the following speech:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious, “avast there a bit,\n      I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and what business ye have\n      here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and swilling the snug blue ruin\n      stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate, Will Wimble, the\n      undertaker!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original company half\n      started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid succession of wild\n      fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the seamen. The\n      president, however, was the first to recover his composure, and at length,\n      turning to Legs with great dignity, recommenced:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of\n      guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then that in these\n      dominions I am monarch, and here rule with undivided empire under the\n      title of ‘King Pest the First.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of\n      Will Wimble the undertaker—a man whom we know not, and whose\n      plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal ears—this\n      apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our Palace, devoted to the\n      councils of our kingdom, and to other sacred and lofty purposes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene Consort. The\n      other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family, and wear\n      the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of ‘His Grace\n      the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous’—‘His Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential’—‘His\n      Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’—and ‘Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess\n      Ana-Pest.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon which we sit\n      here in council, we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns, and\n      concerns alone, our own private and regal interest, and is in no manner\n      important to any other than ourself. But in consideration of those rights\n      to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will\n      furthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep research\n      and accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and thoroughly determine\n      the indefinable spirit—the incomprehensible qualities and nature—of\n      those inestimable treasures of the palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs\n      of this goodly metropolis: by so doing to advance not more our own designs\n      than the true welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us\n      all, whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death’.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the lady by his\n      side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second for himself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention to the\n      worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!—we have said, that in\n      consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy person, we feel no\n      inclination to violate, we have condescended to make reply to thy rude and\n      unseasonable inquiries. We nevertheless, for your unhallowed intrusion\n      upon our councils, believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in\n      each a gallon of Black Strap—having imbibed which to the prosperity\n      of our kingdom—at a single draught—and upon your bended knees—ye\n      shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or remain and be\n      admitted to the privileges of our table, according to your respective and\n      individual pleasures.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied Legs, whom the\n      assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently inspired some\n      feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied himself by the table as he\n      spoke—“it would, please your majesty, be a matter of utter\n      impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same\n      liquor which your majesty has just mentioned. To say nothing of the stuffs\n      placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the\n      various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, I\n      have, at present, a full cargo of ‘humming-stuff’ taken in and duly paid\n      for at the sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore, please your\n      majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed—for by no\n      manner of means either can I or will I swallow another drop—least of\n      all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the name of\n      ‘Black Strap.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the length of\n      his companion’s speech than at the nature of his refusal—“Belay that\n      you lubber!—and I say, Legs, none of your palaver! <i>My</i> hull is still\n      light, although I confess you yourself seem to be a little top-heavy; and\n      as for the matter of your share of the cargo, why rather than raise a\n      squall I would find stowage-room for it myself, but—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in accordance\n      with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in its nature Median,\n      and not to be altered or recalled. The conditions we have imposed must be\n      fulfilled to the letter, and that without a moment’s hesitation—in\n      failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be tied neck and\n      heels together, and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of October\n      beer!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A sentence!—a sentence!—a righteous and just sentence!—a\n      glorious decree!—a most worthy and upright, and holy condemnation!”\n       shouted the Pest family altogether. The king elevated his forehead into\n      innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of\n      bellows; the lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro; the\n      gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud\n      gasped like a dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up\n      his eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general\n      excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—I\n      was saying,” said he, “I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his\n      marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or less\n      of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like myself not\n      overstowed—but when it comes to drinking the health of the Devil\n      (whom God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow bones to his\n      ill-favored majesty there, whom I know, as well as I know myself to be a\n      sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but Tim Hurlygurly the\n      stage-player!—why! it’s quite another guess sort of a thing, and\n      utterly and altogether past my comprehension.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the name Tim\n      Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Treason!” shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Treason!” said the little man with the gout.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Treason!” growled he of the coffin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and, seizing by the\n      hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate Tarpaulin, who had just\n      commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur, she lifted him high\n      into the air, and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open\n      puncheon of his beloved ale. Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like\n      an apple in a bowl of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the\n      whirlpool of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles\n      easily succeeded in creating.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his\n      companion. Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the valiant Legs\n      slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and strode towards the centre\n      of the room. Here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table, he\n      laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as the last\n      glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking\n      out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout. Rushing then with\n      all his force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and Hugh\n      Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. Out burst a deluge of\n      liquor so fierce—so impetuous—so overwhelming—that the\n      room was flooded from wall to wall—the loaded table was overturned—the\n      tressels were thrown upon their backs—the tub of punch into the\n      fire-place—and the ladies into hysterics. Piles of death-furniture\n      floundered about. Jugs, pitchers, and carboys mingled promiscuously in the\n      <i>mêlée</i>, and wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk.\n      The man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot—the little stiff\n      gentleman floated off in his coffin—and the victorious Legs, seizing\n      by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with her into the\n      street, and made a bee-line for the <i>Free and Easy</i>, followed under easy\n      sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who, having sneezed three or four\n      times, panted and puffed after him with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap3.33\"></a>THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK</h2>\n<p>\n      “You hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty, fusty,\n      old savage!” said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking\n      my fist at him in imagination.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy <i>did</i> exist, just\n      then, between what I said and what I had not the courage to say—between\n      what I did and what I had half a mind to do.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting with his\n      feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his paw, making\n      strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Remplis ton verre vide!<br>\n      Vide ton verre plein!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My <i>dear</i> uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and approaching him with\n      the blandest of smiles, “you are always so very kind and considerate, and\n      have evinced your benevolence in so many—so very many ways—that—that\n      I feel I have only to suggest this little point to you once more to make\n      sure of your full acquiescence.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am sure, my dearest uncle (you confounded old rascal!), that you have\n      no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with Kate. This is merely\n      a joke of yours, I know—ha! ha! ha!—how very pleasant you are\n      at times.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure—of course! I knew you were jesting. Now, uncle,\n      all that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us\n      with your advice as—as regards the time—you know,\n      uncle—in short, when will it be most convenient for yourself, that\n      the wedding shall—shall—come off, you know?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that?—Better\n      wait till it goes on.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu!\n      hu! hu!—oh, that’s good!—oh, that’s capital—<i>such</i> a wit! But\n      all we want just <i>now</i>, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time\n      precisely.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah!—precisely?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Wouldn’t it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random—some\n      time within a year or so, for example?—<i>must</i> I say precisely?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>If</i> you please, uncle—precisely.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, aren’t you?—since\n      you <i>will</i> have the exact time I’ll—why I’ll oblige you for once.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dear uncle!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hush, sir!” (drowning my voice)—“I’ll oblige you for once. You\n      shall have my consent—and the <i>plum</i>, we mus’n’t forget the plum—let\n      me see! when shall it be? To-day’s Sunday—isn’t it? Well, then, you\n      shall be married precisely—<i>precisely</i>, now mind!—<i>when three\n      Sundays come together in a week!</i> Do you hear me, sir! <i>What</i> are you gaping\n      at? I say, you shall have Kate and her plum when three Sundays come\n      together in a week—but not <i>till</i> then—you young scapegrace—not\n      <i>till</i> then, if I die for it. You know me—<i>I’m a man of my word</i>—now\n      be off!” Here he swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the\n      room in despair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A very “fine old English gentleman,” was my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, but\n      unlike him of the song, he had his weak points. He was a little, pursy,\n      pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick skull,\n      a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence. With the\n      best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of\n      contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who only knew him\n      superficially, the character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent people,\n      he seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might easily, at\n      a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence. To every request, a\n      positive “No!” was his immediate answer; but in the end—in the long,\n      long end—there were exceedingly few requests which he refused.\n      Against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence; but\n      the amount extorted from him, at last, was generally in direct ratio with\n      the length of the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity\n      no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he entertained a\n      profound contempt. With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier, whose\n      pert little query “A quoi un poete est il bon?” he was in the habit of\n      quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical\n      wit. Thus my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure.\n      He assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace, that the\n      translation of “Poeta nascitur non fit” was “a nasty poet for nothing fit”—a\n      remark which I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to “the humanities”\n       had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias in favor of what\n      he supposed to be natural science. Somebody had accosted him in the\n      street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee,\n      the lecturer upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just\n      at the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after all—my\n      grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which\n      happened to chime in with the caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For\n      the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were\n      stubborn and easily understood. He thought, with Horsley, that “the people\n      have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in dying, had\n      bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. I believe the old villain loved me\n      as his own child—nearly if not quite as well as he loved Kate—but\n      it was a dog’s existence that he led me, after all. From my first year\n      until my fifth, he obliged me with very regular floggings. From five to\n      fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the House of Correction. From\n      fifteen to twenty, not a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me\n      off with a shilling. I was a sad dog, it is true—but then it was a\n      part of my nature—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a\n      firm friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very sweetly\n      that I might have her (plum and all) whenever I could badger my\n      grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent. Poor girl!—she\n      was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her little amount in the\n      funds was not come-at-able until five immeasurable summers had “dragged\n      their slow length along.” What, then, to do? At fifteen, or even at\n      twenty-one (for I had now passed my fifth olympiad) five years in prospect\n      are very much the same as five hundred. In vain we besieged the old\n      gentleman with importunities. Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs\n      Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T. It would\n      have stiffed the indignation of Job himself, to see how much like an old\n      mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little mice. In his heart he\n      wished for nothing more ardently than our union. He had made up his mind\n      to this all along. In fact, he would have given ten thousand pounds from\n      his own pocket (Kate’s plum was her own) if he could have invented any\n      thing like an excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. But then\n      we had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to oppose\n      it under such circumstances, I sincerely believe, was not in his power.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking of these,\n      I must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy: which was one of\n      his strong points—“assurement ce n’ etait pas sa foible.” When I\n      mention his weakness I have allusion to a bizarre old-womanish\n      superstition which beset him. He was great in dreams, portents, et id\n      genus omne of rigmarole. He was excessively punctilious, too, upon small\n      points of honor, and, after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond\n      doubt. This was, in fact, one of his hobbies. The spirit of his vows he\n      made no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter was a bond\n      inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of\n      which Kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day, not long after our\n      interview in the dining-room, to take a very unexpected advantage, and,\n      having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards and orators, exhausted in\n      prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all the room at my\n      disposal, I will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of\n      the story.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among the naval\n      acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just set foot\n      upon the shores of England, after a year’s absence, each, in foreign\n      travel. In company with these gentlemen, my cousin and I, preconcertedly\n      paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of Sunday, October the\n      tenth,—just three weeks after the memorable decision which had so\n      cruelly defeated our hopes. For about half an hour the conversation ran\n      upon ordinary topics, but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to give\n      it the following turn:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      CAPT. PRATT. “Well I have been absent just one year.—Just one year\n      to-day, as I live—let me see! yes!—this is October the tenth.\n      You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called, this day year to bid you good-bye.\n      And by the way, it does seem something like a coincidence, does it not—that\n      our friend, Captain Smitherton, here, has been absent exactly a year also—a\n      year to-day!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      SMITHERTON. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will remember, Mr.\n      Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol on this very day, last year,\n      to pay my parting respects.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very queer\n      indeed! Both of you gone just one year. A very strange coincidence,\n      indeed! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would denominate an extraordinary\n      concurrence of events. Doctor Dub—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      KATE. (Interrupting.) “To be sure, papa, it is something strange; but then\n      Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton didn’t go altogether the same route,\n      and that makes a difference, you know.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzy! How should I? I think it\n      only makes the matter more remarkable, Doctor Dubble L. Dee—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      KATE. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain\n      Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “Precisely!—the one went east and the other went west, you\n      jade, and they both have gone quite round the world. By the by, Doctor\n      Dubble L. Dee—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      MYSELF. (Hurriedly.) “Captain Pratt, you must come and spend the evening\n      with us to-morrow—you and Smitherton—you can tell us all about\n      your voyage, and we’ll have a game of whist and—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      PRATT. “Wist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow will be Sunday.\n      Some other evening—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      KATE. “Oh, no, fie!—Robert’s not quite so bad as that. To-day’s\n      Sunday.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      PRATT. “I beg both your pardons—but I can’t be so much mistaken. I\n      know to-morrow’s Sunday, because-”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      SMITHERTON. (Much surprised.) “What are you all thinking about? Wasn’t\n      yesterday, Sunday, I should like to know?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      ALL. “Yesterday indeed! you are out!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “To-day’s Sunday, I say—don’t I know?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      PRATT. “Oh no!—to-morrow’s Sunday.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      SMITHERTON. “You are all mad—every one of you. I am as positive that\n      yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      KATE. (Jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa, this is a\n      judgment upon you, about—about you know what. Let me alone, and I’ll\n      explain it all in a minute. It’s a very simple thing, indeed. Captain\n      Smitherton says that yesterday was Sunday: so it was; he is right. Cousin\n      Bobby, and uncle and I say that to-day is Sunday: so it is; we are right.\n      Captain Pratt maintains that to-morrow will be Sunday: so it will; he is\n      right, too. The fact is, we are all right, and thus three Sundays have\n      come together in a week.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      SMITHERTON. (After a pause.) “By the by, Pratt, Kate has us completely.\n      What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter stands thus: the earth,\n      you know, is twenty-four thousand miles in circumference. Now this globe\n      of the earth turns upon its own axis—revolves—spins round—these\n      twenty-four thousand miles of extent, going from west to east, in\n      precisely twenty-four hours. Do you understand, Mr. Rumgudgeon?—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      SMITHERTON. (Drowning his voice.) “Well, sir; that is at the rate of one\n      thousand miles per hour. Now, suppose that I sail from this position a\n      thousand miles east. Of course I anticipate the rising of the sun here at\n      London by just one hour. I see the sun rise one hour before you do.\n      Proceeding, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, I\n      anticipate the rising by two hours—another thousand, and I\n      anticipate it by three hours, and so on, until I go entirely round the\n      globe, and back to this spot, when, having gone twenty-four thousand miles\n      east, I anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than\n      twenty-four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your time.\n      Understand, eh?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “But Double L. Dee—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      SMITHERTON. (Speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on the contrary, when he\n      had sailed a thousand miles west of this position, was an hour, and when\n      he had sailed twenty-four thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or\n      one day, behind the time at London. Thus, with me, yesterday was Sunday—thus,\n      with you, to-day is Sunday—and thus, with Pratt, to-morrow will be\n      Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it is positively clear that we\n      are all right; for there can be no philosophical reason assigned why the\n      idea of one of us should have preference over that of the other.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      UNCLE. “My eyes!—well, Kate—well, Bobby!—this is a\n      judgment upon me, as you say. But I am a man of my word—mark that!\n      you shall have her, boy, (plum and all), when you please. Done up, by\n      Jove! Three Sundays all in a row! I’ll go, and take Dubble L. Dee’s\n      opinion upon that.”\n     </p>\n"

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.1\"></a>PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE.</h2>\n<p>\n      In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their\n      residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little\n      sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, <i>meliora probant,\n      deteriora </i>sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts\n      to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a\n      delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The\n      Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.\n      The Scotch are <i>poor </i>decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an\n      indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are <i>all\n      </i>curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The\n      Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are\n      preposterous.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of\n      blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable\n      thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the <i>display\n      of wealth </i>has here to take the place and perform the office of the\n      heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily\n      understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been\n      brought to merge in simple <i>show</i> our notions of taste itself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of\n      costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an\n      impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or\n      of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that\n      wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting\n      a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,\n      confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather\n      avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a <i>parvenu </i>rivalry\n      may at any time be successfully attempted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The people <i>will </i>imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough\n      diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being\n      the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,\n      to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,\n      looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two\n      entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of\n      an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole\n      test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once\n      established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable\n      to the one primitive folly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist\n      than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to\n      say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual\n      defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would\n      of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are\n      amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of\n      art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits\n      of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several\n      pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation\n      to use <i>Very </i>often the eye is offended by their inartistic\n      arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly\n      continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines\n      occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,\n      the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other\n      decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an\n      extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,\n      irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the\n      proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still\n      very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the\n      apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the\n      forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary\n      man; a good judge of a carpet <i>must be </i>a genius. Yet we have heard\n      discoursing of carpets, with the air “<i>d’un mouton qui reve,” </i>fellows\n      who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their\n      own <i>moustaches. </i>Every one knows that a large floor <i>may </i>have\n      a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of\n      small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards\n      texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect\n      tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching\n      pattern—a carpet should <i>not </i>be bedizzened out like a Riccaree\n      Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct\n      grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, <i>of no meaning, </i>are\n      here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of\n      well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of\n      Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or\n      ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly\n      Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth &amp; still occasionally seen\n      in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and\n      radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among\n      which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention\n      of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and\n      worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize\n      fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established\n      joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Glare</i> is a leading error in the philosophy of American household\n      decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion\n      of taste just specified. We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.\n      The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady\n      light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or\n      what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do\n      wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely\n      thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp\n      proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass\n      shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is\n      a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted\n      it, partly on account of its <i>flashiness</i>, but principally on account\n      of its <i>greater rest</i>, is a good commentary on the proposition with\n      which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of\n      a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly\n      subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of\n      these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is\n      sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its\n      influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half\n      disenchanted beneath its evil eye.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its\n      leading feature is <i>glitter—</i>and in that one word how much of\n      all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are <i>sometimes\n      </i>pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the\n      embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,\n      even strong <i>steady </i>lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning\n      glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle\n      in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of\n      all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The rage for <i>glitter-</i>because its idea has become as we before\n      observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has\n      led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our\n      dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine\n      thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one\n      who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and\n      especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror\n      presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing\n      always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent\n      in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here\n      aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its\n      sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four\n      or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,\n      a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter\n      upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing\n      effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,\n      would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be\n      altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the\n      same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be\n      startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man\n      of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The\n      corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.\n      As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among <i>our\n      </i>aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the\n      spirituality of a British <i>boudoir. </i>But we have seen apartments in\n      the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]\n      means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the <i>or-molu’d\n      </i>cabinets of our friends across the water. Even <i>now</i>, there is\n      present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose\n      decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the\n      weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of\n      the room during his slumber.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a\n      shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of\n      furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is\n      at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the\n      other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep\n      recesses—and open on an Italian <i>veranda. </i>Their panes are of a\n      crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.\n      They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to\n      the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the\n      recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a\n      deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material\n      of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole\n      fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),\n      issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles\n      the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown\n      open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping\n      it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such\n      devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the\n      tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and\n      determine the <i>character </i>of the room. The carpet—of Saxony\n      material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson\n      ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that\n      festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the <i>ground,\n      </i>and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short\n      irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls\n      are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small\n      Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many\n      paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an\n      imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the\n      lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or\n      four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.\n      The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant\n      effects.” <i>Repose </i>speaks in all. Not one is of small size.\n      Diminutive paintings give that <i>spotty </i>look to a room, which is the\n      blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad\n      but not deep, and richly carved, without being <i>dulled </i>or filagreed.\n      They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,\n      and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to\n      better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of\n      the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is\n      visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a\n      reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary\n      sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson\n      silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light\n      conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,\n      also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed\n      altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the\n      sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has\n      been thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which\n      bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded\n      angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with\n      highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some\n      light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk\n      cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound\n      books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand\n      lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from\n      He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a\n      tranquil but magical radiance over all.\n    </p>\n",

When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their\n      own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us\n      lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver\n      shekels per head!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the\n      Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,\n      has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,\n      to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged\n      to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of\n      <i>dashing </i>and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a\n      thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less\n      gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a\n      priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a\n      blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of\n      appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated\n      elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted\n      Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or\n      by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings\n      should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not\n      extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which\n      bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly\n      fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty\n      hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the\n      solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its\n      inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square\n      towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and\n      twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the\n      wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,\n      between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a\n      perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the\n      precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived\n      on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the\n      turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the\n      besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an\n      eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by\n      several, that of the temple of Belus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,\n      “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the\n      wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,\n      not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who\n      seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman\n      soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions\n      of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has\n      broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your\n      gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought\n      fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a\n      true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the\n      ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the\n      world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every\n      kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and\n      see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the\n      centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against\n      the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth\n      the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of\n      the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is\n      it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or\n      Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or\n      Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or\n      Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too\n      rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on\n      the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the\n      holy things of the sanctuary.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden\n      basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the\n      giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but\n      owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of\n      their operations could be obtained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Half an hour had already elapsed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this\n      period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be\n      turned out of office by the Katholim.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the\n      fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our\n      loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase\n      money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they\n      have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,\n      Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either\n      still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to\n      place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while\n      their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the\n      extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was\n      the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of\n      Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the\n      bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are\n      more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the\n      honey of Hebron.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the\n      heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our\n      voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the\n      psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim\n      that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a <i>hog</i> of no common size.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,\n      letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\n      Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is <i>the unutterable\n      flesh!”</i>\n</p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.3\"></a>THE SPHINX</h2>\n<p>\n      During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the\n      invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\n      of his <i>cottage ornée</i> on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\n      us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in\n      the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we\n      should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\n      intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a\n      day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\n      acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\n      the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\n      messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\n      That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could\n      neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less\n      excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted\n      himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at\n      any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was\n      sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which\n      I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which\n      I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into\n      germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my\n      bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he\n      was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been\n      made upon my fancy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief\n      which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to\n      defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he\n      maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I\n      contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute\n      spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of\n      suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and\n      was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the\n      idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred\n      to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so\n      much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for\n      regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded\n      and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind\n      to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an\n      open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view\n      of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded\n      by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My\n      thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom\n      and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,\n      they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon\n      some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its\n      way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense\n      forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own\n      sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes\n      passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor\n      in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and\n      calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I\n      fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than\n      even I did myself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the\n      large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which\n      had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far\n      larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,\n      because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one\n      of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the\n      general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of\n      a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\n      the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an\n      immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been\n      supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\n      hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those\n      of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,\n      parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,\n      thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in\n      shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the\n      rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the\n      apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each\n      wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above\n      the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale\n      apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper\n      and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief\n      peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s\n      Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was\n      as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,\n      as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded\n      the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,\n      with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming\n      evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I\n      perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand\n      themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so\n      expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the\n      monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to\n      the floor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of\n      what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\n      repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\n      were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I\n      occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near\n      at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an\n      account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed\n      heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if\n      my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a\n      distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute\n      terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but\n      maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the\n      course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the\n      hill.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\n      omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\n      threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my\n      face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer\n      apparent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,\n      and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the\n      visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed\n      deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,\n      with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative\n      philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.\n      I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the\n      idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in\n      the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the\n      importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its\n      propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence\n      to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of\n      Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly\n      be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can\n      you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought\n      this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one\n      of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\n      exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\n      print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\n      book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,\n      I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.\n      In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus\n      Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class\n      of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\n      appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of\n      the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and\n      downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;\n      antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The\n      Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,\n      at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia\n      of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself\n      accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding\n      “the monster.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face\n      of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\n      Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for\n      the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider\n      has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of\n      an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch\n      distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.4\"></a>HOP-FROG</h2>\n<p>\n      I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed\n      to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to\n      tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his\n      seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They\n      all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well\n      as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there\n      is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been\n      quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara\n      avis in terris.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king\n      troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in\n      a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.\n      Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”\n      to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited\n      his taste far better than verbal ones.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone\n      out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still\n      retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were\n      expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,\n      in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Our</i> king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he\n      <i>required</i> something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the\n      heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to\n      mention himself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value\n      was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf\n      and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;\n      and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days\n      (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to\n      laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your\n      jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and\n      unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our\n      king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a\n      triplicate treasure in one person.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was <i>not</i> that given to the dwarf by his\n      sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of\n      the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men\n      do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional\n      gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that\n      afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,\n      for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional\n      swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a\n      capital figure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only\n      with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious\n      muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way\n      of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform\n      many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,\n      or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more\n      resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog\n      originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no\n      person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.\n      Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself\n      (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been\n      forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,\n      and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close\n      intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became\n      sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was\n      by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many\n      services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although\n      a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much\n      influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit\n      of Hop-Frog.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined\n      to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,\n      occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta\n      were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive\n      in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and\n      arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it\n      seems, without his assistance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been\n      fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could\n      possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of\n      expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed\n      that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up\n      their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,\n      in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except\n      in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never\n      could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found\n      it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all\n      events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and\n      Hop-Frog.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him\n      sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the\n      monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not\n      fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and\n      madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,\n      and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)\n      “to be merry.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the\n      room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here\n      Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We\n      want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of\n      the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the\n      wine will brighten your wits.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances\n      from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor\n      dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced\n      the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he\n      took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly\n      drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,\n      your eyes are shining already!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of\n      wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He\n      placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the\n      company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at\n      the success of the king’s ‘joke.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your\n      assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of\n      characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was\n      seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,\n      abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you\n      mean by <i>that?</i> Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.\n      Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and\n      offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the\n      fiends—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers\n      smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,\n      falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her\n      audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most\n      becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a\n      syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the\n      brimming goblet in her face.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,\n      resumed her position at the foot of the table.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling\n      of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a\n      low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once\n      from every corner of the room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the\n      king, turning furiously to the dwarf.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his\n      intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,\n      merely ejaculated:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I—I? How could it have been me?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.\n      “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his\n      cage-wires.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,\n      on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of\n      this vagabond’s teeth.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object\n      to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very\n      repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as\n      much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another\n      bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and\n      with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very\n      tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just\n      after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just\n      after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd\n      noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one\n      of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our\n      masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,\n      it requires a company of eight persons and—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the\n      coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!\n      what is the diversion?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and\n      it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering\n      his eyelids.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it\n      occasions among the women.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that\n      to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of\n      masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will\n      be as much terrified as astonished.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man\n      of you.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their\n      jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.\n      Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by\n      eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the\n      company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately\n      and gorgeously habited men and women. The <i>contrast</i> is inimitable.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was\n      growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but\n      effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the\n      epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized\n      world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently\n      beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to\n      nature was thus thought to be secured.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet\n      shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of\n      the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion\n      was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by\n      ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang\n      was much more efficiently represented by <i>flax</i>. A thick coating of\n      the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long\n      chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,\n      <i>and tied;</i> then about another of the party, and also tied; then\n      about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining\n      arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each\n      other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear\n      natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at\n      right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the\n      present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in\n      Borneo.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular\n      room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single\n      window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially\n      designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending\n      by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by\n      means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)\n      this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;\n      but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer\n      judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this\n      occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in\n      weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been\n      seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account\n      of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from\n      out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional\n      sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a\n      flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the\n      Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or\n      sixty altogether.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until\n      midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before\n      making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,\n      than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the\n      impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to\n      stumble as they entered.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart\n      of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of\n      the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of\n      some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women\n      swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to\n      exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated\n      their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the\n      doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his\n      entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with\n      him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to\n      his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure\n      of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,\n      and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very\n      gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of\n      the floor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the\n      hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,\n      of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus\n      situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting\n      them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the\n      intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically\n      and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the\n      hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an\n      instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far\n      upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable\n      consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and\n      face to face.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their\n      alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived\n      pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the\n      apes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself\n      easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.\n      If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the\n      wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,\n      as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a\n      monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the\n      chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and\n      still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with\n      laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain\n      flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the\n      dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in\n      mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the\n      chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the\n      eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to\n      thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who\n      they were.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead\n      silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such\n      a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the\n      king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of\n      Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to\n      whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the\n      dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and\n      glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned\n      countenances of the king and his seven companions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see\n      who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more\n      closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and\n      which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a\n      minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the\n      shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,\n      and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester\n      to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made\n      this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.\n      The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I now see distinctly,” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.\n      They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who\n      does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors\n      who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the\n      jester—and this is my last jest.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it\n      adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the\n      work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a\n      fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled\n      his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared\n      through the sky-light.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had\n      been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,\n      together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was\n      seen again.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.5\"></a>THE MAN OF THE CROWD.</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\nCe grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—<i>La Bruyère</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      It was well said of a certain German book that “<i>er lasst sich nicht\n      lesen</i>”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some\n      secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in\n      their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them\n      piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of\n      throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer\n      themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes\n      up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the\n      grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the\n      large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some\n      months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with\n      returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so\n      precisely the converse of <i>ennui</i>—moods of the keenest\n      appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the\n      αχλυξ η πριυ\n      επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,\n      surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet\n      candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely\n      to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many\n      of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest\n      in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had\n      been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring\n      over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the\n      room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had\n      been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,\n      the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well\n      lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past\n      the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been\n      in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,\n      therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all\n      care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of\n      the scene without.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked\n      at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate\n      relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute\n      interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,\n      and expression of countenance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied\n      business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way\n      through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;\n      when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of\n      impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a\n      numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and\n      talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on\n      account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their\n      progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their\n      gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the\n      lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed\n      profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There\n      was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I\n      have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly\n      termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,\n      tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of\n      society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their\n      own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not\n      greatly excite my attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable\n      divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young\n      gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and\n      supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which\n      may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these\n      persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection\n      of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off\n      graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best\n      definition of the class.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old\n      fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats\n      and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white\n      cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or\n      gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right\n      ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I\n      observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,\n      and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient\n      pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed\n      there be an affectation so honorable.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily\n      understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all\n      great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much\n      inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be\n      mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of\n      wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily\n      recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the\n      desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,\n      gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate\n      clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still\n      all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a\n      filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two\n      other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded\n      lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of\n      the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in\n      company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat\n      different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be\n      defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon\n      the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the\n      military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and\n      smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and\n      deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing\n      from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of\n      abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon\n      mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the\n      night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed\n      a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every\n      one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,\n      some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a\n      cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the\n      glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;\n      women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal\n      beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in\n      Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with\n      filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the\n      wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at\n      youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,\n      an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid\n      ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards\n      innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,\n      inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole\n      although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual\n      lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials\n      which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well\n      brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy\n      step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously\n      wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode\n      through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside\n      these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,\n      monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who\n      sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all\n      full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the\n      ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for\n      not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its\n      gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly\n      portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,\n      as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but\n      the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the\n      dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing\n      a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony\n      to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual\n      faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted\n      before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each\n      visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could\n      frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of\n      long years.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,\n      when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old\n      man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which\n      at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the\n      absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely\n      resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that\n      my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,\n      would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the\n      fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to\n      form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and\n      paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,\n      of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood\n      thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of\n      supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How\n      wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then\n      came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.\n      Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my\n      way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I\n      had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little\n      difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed\n      him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in\n      stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,\n      were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong\n      glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of\n      beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a\n      closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped\n      him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These\n      observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the\n      stranger whithersoever he should go.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,\n      soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd\n      effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new\n      commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the\n      jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did\n      not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system\n      rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a\n      handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held\n      his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked\n      close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning\n      his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a\n      cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so\n      much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his\n      demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than\n      before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way\n      repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at\n      every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a\n      narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,\n      during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number\n      which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a\n      difference is there between a London populace and that of the most\n      frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,\n      brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the\n      stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled\n      wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who\n      hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was\n      surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the\n      square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished\n      to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting\n      me as he came round with a sudden movement.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with\n      far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;\n      the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a\n      gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively\n      deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an\n      activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put\n      me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and\n      busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well\n      acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he\n      forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and\n      sellers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,\n      it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without\n      attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc\n      over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he\n      see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke\n      no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now\n      utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not\n      part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the\n      bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and\n      at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into\n      the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with\n      incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we\n      emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the\n      street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same\n      aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and\n      there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked\n      moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,\n      turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great\n      variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the\n      principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were\n      thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he\n      threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his\n      countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his\n      breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now\n      took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,\n      upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his\n      actions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness\n      and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of\n      some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped\n      off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane\n      little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in\n      thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which\n      brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from\n      those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of\n      London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable\n      poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an\n      accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen\n      tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce\n      the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones\n      lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.\n      Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere\n      teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life\n      revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned\n      of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old\n      man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more\n      he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze\n      of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge\n      suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,\n      Gin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still\n      pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy\n      the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original\n      bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among\n      the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to\n      the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was\n      something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the\n      countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.\n      Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced\n      his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he\n      fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to\n      abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun\n      arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most\n      thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——\n      Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely\n      inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid\n      the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the\n      stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not\n      pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the\n      second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in\n      front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed\n      me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained\n      absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,\n      “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.\n      <i>He is the man of the crowd.</i> It will be in vain to follow; for I\n      shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the\n      world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and\n      perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘<i>er lasst\n      sich nicht lesen.</i>’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      {*1} The “<i>Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis</i>”\n       of Grünninger.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.6\"></a>NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD</h2>\n<h3>\n      A Tale With a Moral.\n    </h3>\n<p>\n      “<i>Con tal que las costumbres de un autor</i>,” says Don Thomas de las\n      Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” <i>“sean puras y castas,\n      importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”</i>—meaning,\n      in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\n      personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\n      presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be\n      a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there\n      until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon\n      the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,\n      what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every\n      fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon\n      the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a\n      distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that\n      the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and\n      drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by\n      Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;\n      by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.\n      Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a\n      hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views\n      in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it\n      has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound\n      design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for\n      example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,\n      it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of\n      themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,\n      and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”\n       or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,\n      and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all\n      come very straight in the end.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\n      certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in\n      more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics\n      predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the\n      secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them\n      ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by\n      way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history\n      appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no\n      question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals\n      which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this\n      arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who\n      reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus\n      sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur</i> was a law of the twelve tables, and <i>De\n      mortuis nil nisi bonum</i> is an excellent injunction—even if the dead\n      in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,\n      therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad\n      dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was\n      not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his\n      mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for\n      duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,\n      like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the\n      better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be\n      left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left\n      unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a\n      baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an\n      evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\n      its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\n      and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\n      getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my\n      eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he\n      had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have\n      mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond\n      that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,\n      but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made\n      prophecy of his ruin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he\n      used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six\n      months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in\n      the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight\n      months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance\n      pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,\n      at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing\n      moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and\n      for backing his assertions by bets.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\n      predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with\n      his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to\n      be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with\n      a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will\n      do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With\n      him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on\n      this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if\n      not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to\n      round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever\n      thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty\n      to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a\n      vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by\n      society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act\n      of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.\n      I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I\n      entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he\n      sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the\n      police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil\n      his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\n      Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\n      this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\n      betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I\n      ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\n      dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\n      what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\n      still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it\n      involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.\n      Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have\n      been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\n      that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\n      question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a\n      man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which\n      my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\n      In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to\n      “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of\n      devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\n      displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a\n      man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something\n      in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his\n      offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which\n      at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something\n      which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to\n      call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant\n      pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.\n      I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I\n      resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve\n      him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the\n      toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I\n      addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to\n      remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at\n      expostulation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some\n      very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely\n      looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to\n      one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out\n      the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with\n      the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut\n      them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became\n      seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his\n      nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of\n      his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to\n      me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all\n      my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still\n      think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?\n      Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in\n      a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this\n      latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself\n      to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother\n      knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be\n      willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left\n      my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he\n      did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For\n      once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won\n      for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my\n      mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans\n      say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I\n      had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\n      however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of\n      this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my\n      counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I\n      forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up\n      his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less\n      reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself\n      lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so\n      profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us\n      in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross\n      it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the\n      archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we\n      entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the\n      interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the\n      unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.\n      He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so\n      much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not\n      impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well\n      enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with\n      decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of\n      the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain\n      species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,\n      and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve\n      him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came\n      in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd\n      little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the\n      time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.\n      At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the\n      termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile\n      of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as\n      usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted\n      upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the\n      air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The\n      best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and\n      as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by\n      Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\n      braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\n      sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his\n      head that he could.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\n      remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\n      slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\n      started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a\n      nook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a\n      little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more\n      reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of\n      black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly\n      down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a\n      girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and\n      his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\n      apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\n      odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\n      circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,\n      remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a\n      Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,\n      therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman\n      says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\n      for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\n      particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is\n      pretty sure to look like a fool.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,\n      than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I\n      suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not\n      think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\n      speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\n      eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or\n      knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could\n      hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those\n      simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the\n      gentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a\n      pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you\n      quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may\n      as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.\n      He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\n      gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all\n      the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated\n      benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\n      all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of\n      mere form.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a\n      pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\n      alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\n      the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\n      pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\n      after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud—“this\n      is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\n      a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\n      induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\n      questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him\n      my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and\n      looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade\n      of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”\n       said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait\n      here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go\n      over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of\n      the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and\n      away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away.’” Here he took his position by\n      the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up\n      and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his\n      apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as\n      agreed upon—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n<i>One—two—three—and—away!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop.\n      The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s—nor yet very low, like\n      that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would\n      clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what\n      if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to make any\n      other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he\n      asks me to jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who the\n      devil he is.” The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very\n      ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all\n      times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when\n      I uttered the four last words of my remark.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\n      instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\n      taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of\n      the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.\n      I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the\n      top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing\n      that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of\n      a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections,\n      down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the\n      stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old\n      gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up\n      in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the\n      arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had\n      no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded\n      that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my\n      assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might\n      be termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his\n      head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I\n      determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists. In the\n      meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the\n      bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. About five feet just\n      above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so\n      as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its\n      breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to\n      strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this\n      brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come\n      precisely in contact.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homœopathists did not give\n      him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated\n      to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all\n      riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister\n      on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral,\n      sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels\n      refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for\n      dog’s meat.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.7\"></a>THOU ART THE MAN</h2>\n<p>\n      I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound to\n      you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected\n      the Rattleborough miracle—the one, the true, the admitted, the\n      undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to\n      infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the\n      grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of\n      unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas\n      Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of\n      the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances\n      which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out\n      from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the\n      avowed intention of proceeding to the city of ——, about fifteen miles\n      distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his\n      departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the\n      saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal\n      was wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave\n      rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was\n      found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the\n      whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom\n      friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was\n      universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”\n       Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the\n      name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never\n      yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there\n      never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest,\n      good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did\n      you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the\n      face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of\n      no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” And thus all the\n      hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be\n      called Charles.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough not\n      longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing\n      about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no\n      difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable\n      people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare\n      word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no\n      saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of\n      his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence,\n      that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of\n      recommendation.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable\n      and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while “Old\n      Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been\n      his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and,\n      although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “Old Charley,” and\n      never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent\n      the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed;\n      for “Old Charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four\n      times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to\n      breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine\n      that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be\n      a difficult thing to ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was\n      Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to\n      see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one\n      day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat\n      out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back—“I tell\n      you what it is, ‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old\n      fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to\n      guzzle the wine at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make\n      thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”—(Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond\n      “Od rot me,” or “By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)—“Od rot me,”\n       says he, “if I don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a\n      double box of the best that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it,\n      I will!—ye needn’t say a word now—I will, I tell ye, and\n      there’s an end of it; so look out for it—it will come to hand some\n      of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” I\n      mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy,\n      just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed\n      between the two friends.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly\n      understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any\n      one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he first\n      heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his\n      master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone\n      clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing\n      him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had\n      been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if\n      he had had a fit of the ague.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing\n      at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he\n      endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a\n      stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a\n      week or two, or a month, or two—to see if something wouldn’t turn\n      up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain\n      his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often\n      observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who\n      are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to\n      be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action,\n      and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse\n      their grief,” as the old ladies express it—that is to say, ruminate\n      over the trouble.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom\n      and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them felt\n      disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until\n      something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I\n      believe that, after all this would have been the general determination,\n      but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a\n      young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad\n      character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to\n      nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon\n      making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.” This\n      was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the\n      time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” This remark of\n      “Old Charley’s,” too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the\n      party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr.\n      Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances\n      connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to\n      assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered\n      man.’” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various\n      members of the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.\n      Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no\n      means a novelty, for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for\n      the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.\n      Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle’s friend for some alleged\n      excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which\n      the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old Charley” is said to have\n      behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the\n      blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely\n      muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first\n      convenient opportunity,”—a natural and very justifiable ebullition\n      of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner\n      given vent to than forgotten.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at\n      issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally\n      through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the\n      determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the\n      missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the\n      first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be\n      made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should\n      disperse—that is to say, distribute themselves in parties—for\n      the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget,\n      however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “Old Charley”\n       finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan\n      that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did—all except Mr.\n      Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be\n      instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “Old\n      Charley” himself leading the way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than\n      “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but,\n      although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners,\n      by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood,\n      and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a\n      week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say\n      no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace,\n      to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked,\n      by his horse’s shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to\n      the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the\n      track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path\n      coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of\n      the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party\n      came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles,\n      to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track\n      was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature\n      had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much\n      larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the\n      pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and\n      the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any\n      result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of\n      draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,\n      and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and\n      consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,\n      supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,\n      the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom\n      visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered\n      a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately\n      recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much\n      torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the\n      party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner\n      on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while\n      there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that\n      Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the\n      remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he\n      had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was\n      observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were\n      excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he\n      had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon,\n      the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at\n      once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed\n      enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the\n      magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant\n      lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of\n      Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere\n      forgiveness of that wild young gentleman—“the heir of the worthy Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy,”—for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had,\n      no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr.\n      Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of\n      his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the\n      suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really\n      had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every\n      exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his\n      possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could\n      conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly\n      perplexing piece of business.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much\n      to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted\n      people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all\n      sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the\n      hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the\n      kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his\n      cause than to advance it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old\n      Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected,\n      yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of\n      which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in\n      the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion\n      already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse\n      against him the fury of the mob.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his\n      allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They\n      had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or\n      two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the\n      nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance\n      as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were\n      the Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once\n      to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the\n      possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And\n      straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?—a\n      question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible\n      crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me\n      to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and\n      simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and\n      misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,—in\n      those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who\n      quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her\n      learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,—in\n      all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of\n      Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little\n      Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,)\n      “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose\n      advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal\n      phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under\n      consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the\n      probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the\n      deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?\n      very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him,\n      after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had\n      not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been\n      altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the\n      part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and\n      even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the\n      good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat\n      to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once\n      the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded,\n      very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd,\n      after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. On\n      the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the\n      suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a\n      little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few\n      paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the\n      grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of\n      half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was\n      noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up\n      was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized\n      as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved\n      upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon\n      reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being\n      questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\n      disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that\n      very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the\n      immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had\n      been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked\n      permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed\n      his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to\n      remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man\n      (notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)\n      had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest,\n      by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the\n      circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these\n      circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning; he\n      would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew, although his\n      heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He\n      then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had\n      mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that his\n      object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an\n      unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank,” and\n      that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to\n      the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will\n      originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the witness)\n      now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the\n      witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial\n      particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr.\n      Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables\n      to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From this\n      search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound,\n      russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit\n      of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been\n      abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the\n      prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their\n      concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.\n      The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the\n      unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials\n      of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had\n      just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received,\n      and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of\n      the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of\n      discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate\n      beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after\n      considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect\n      and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial,\n      was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather’s rifle,\n      while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or\n      its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet\n      was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture,\n      and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental\n      ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself\n      to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining\n      magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately\n      committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in\n      the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly\n      remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be\n      required. This generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in\n      accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct\n      during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the\n      present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the\n      excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten,\n      when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr.\n      Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the\n      face of the earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,\n      amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at\n      the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence\n      (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.\n      Goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the\n      court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the\n      jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of\n      “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch\n      received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await\n      the inexorable vengeance of the law.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had\n      doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became ten\n      times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the\n      hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,\n      the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled\n      him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house,\n      when wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little, of course, by the\n      occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended\n      over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at\n      the receipt of the following letter:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"letter\">\nCharles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough<br>\nFrom H.F.B. &amp; Co.<br>\nChat. Mar. A—No. 1.—6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)<br>\n<br>\n“Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dear Sir—In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm\nabout two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus\nShuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your address, a\ndouble box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet seal. Box numbered\nand marked as per margin.\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n“We remain, sir,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n“Your most ob’nt ser’ts,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n“HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, &amp; CO.<br>\n</p>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n“City of—, June 21, 18—.<br>\n“P.S.—The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your\nreceipt of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n“H., F., B., &amp; CO.”\n</p>\n<p>\n      The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised\n      Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of\n      especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly\n      delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large\n      party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of\n      broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said any\n      thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the\n      invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at\n      all. He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that\n      he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends\n      to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich\n      flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and\n      of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often puzzled\n      myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the conclusion to\n      say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I\n      could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he\n      had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly\n      respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough\n      was there,—I myself among the number,—but, much to the\n      vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late\n      hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been\n      done very ample justice by the guests. It came at length, however,—a\n      monstrously big box of it there was, too—and as the whole party were\n      in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be\n      lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had\n      the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a\n      few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was pretty\n      much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with\n      an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously\n      upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during\n      the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very\n      often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued.\n      Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, “with\n      an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few\n      slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at\n      the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing\n      the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered\n      Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and\n      sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the\n      countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and\n      impressively, the words—“Thou art the man!” and then, falling over\n      the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs\n      quiveringly upon the table.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the\n      doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the\n      room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,\n      shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If\n      I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony\n      which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with\n      triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of\n      marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be\n      turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,\n      murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out\n      into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his\n      chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and\n      in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed\n      confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then\n      imprisoned and doomed to die.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What he recounted was in substance this:—He followed his victim to\n      the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched\n      its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and,\n      supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by\n      the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and\n      thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through\n      the woods.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by\n      himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.\n      Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained\n      handkerchief and shirt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty\n      wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted, he\n      arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell—<i>dead</i>.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although\n      efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had\n      disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present when\n      Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then\n      arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat\n      of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared\n      to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from\n      that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw\n      at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or\n      indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the\n      true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in\n      the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers\n      had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and\n      another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after\n      having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by\n      the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the\n      idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be\n      capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and\n      also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr.\n      Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong\n      because I kept it altogether to myself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of\n      Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as\n      divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his\n      party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry\n      well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the\n      bottom, I discovered what I sought.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two\n      cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the\n      promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a\n      stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and\n      deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body\n      up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press\n      forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I\n      anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top\n      would fly off and the body up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as\n      already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants\n      with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to\n      wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal\n      from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I\n      confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I\n      counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was\n      released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by\n      the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever\n      afterward a new life.\n    </p>\n",

First of all\n      it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two\n      peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she\n      clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me if it didn’t spake to\n      me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass:\n      “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,\n      mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it’s\n      mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’\n      day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be\n      bate in the purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart\n      altegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and\n      thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, “True for you,\n      yer a swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be\n      drownthed dead in a bog, if it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\n      Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the\n      twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry purraty.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind whither\n      it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the widdy by\n      way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid an illigant\n      card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could rade the\n      copperplate printin’ on account of being lift handed) was all about\n      Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and that\n      the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little\n      ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made me\n      a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing\n      me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a\n      great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the\n      tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said “pully wou,\n      woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad luck to him, that\n      he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy\n      Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a\n      grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\n      Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the\n      upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and kipt\n      dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what\n      did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud give me\n      the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,\n      Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see now\n      whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer\n      Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it was\n      an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor, and\n      in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil knows\n      what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in\n      all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the swate\n      little angel, Misthress Tracle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made\n      sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the\n      brain o’ ye.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner\n      Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this\n      gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and\n      isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and\n      acquaintance that I have in the houl world?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest\n      curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and\n      thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns\n      that plumped his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon! I\n      ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head on the spot, I was\n      so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after awhile. “Is it there\n      ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I plumped on the lift side\n      of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain. Botheration! it wud ha done\n      your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived her jist\n      thin right in the face with both eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at\n      all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. “Woully\n      wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I talked\n      as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was mesilf\n      jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by rason of the\n      illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of\n      Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of\n      her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took\n      hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in\n      natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner did\n      she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid\n      it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as to say,\n      “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,\n      mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the\n      squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner\n      Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for\n      the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have\n      died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm\n      betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,\n      sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the tip\n      o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And wasn’t it\n      mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the\n      world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her\n      leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest\n      of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thunder, Sir\n      Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s jist the mother’s\n      son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the handsomest and the\n      fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And\n      with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the\n      powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would ha split the\n      seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to behould, jist then all at once, the\n      consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a\n      jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her\n      leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it\n      wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out\n      of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny\n      cat I shud like to be tould who it was!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as iver\n      ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the\n      likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a-goggling at her\n      leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze as it\n      was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir Pathrick\n      now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the protectin’ o’ you, my darlint?” and\n      then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the answer. “Thrue for\n      you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world,\n      “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman\n      ye are—that’s God’s truth,” and with that she opened her two\n      beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out of her hid\n      althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat at Mounseer\n      Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and\n      then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his\n      hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his\n      purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git\n      out o’ the spalpeen.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,\n      and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the\n      widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much\n      as to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I just\n      ripped out wid a big oath, and says I:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”—and\n      jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she jumped\n      up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through the door, while I\n      turned my head round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and\n      botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I had a\n      reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down the stares\n      althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had hould of her\n      hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says I:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that\n      ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now,\n      that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But\n      aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I turned round to the\n      little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little\n      paw that I had hould of in my own—why thin—thin it\n      wasn’t—that’s all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,\n      to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at\n      all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick\n      O’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he\n      pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the\n      likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake.\n      Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I left hould\n      of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship’s\n      futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a nate little\n      broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he—“Cot tam!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a\n      sling.\n    </p>\n",

That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled\n      in the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially\n      undeniable. His <i>patés à la fois</i> were beyond doubt immaculate; but\n      what pen can do justice to his essays <i>sur la Nature</i>—his\n      thoughts <i>sur l’Ame</i>—his observations <i>sur l’Esprit?</i> If\n      his <i>omelettes</i>—if his <i>fricandeaux</i> were inestimable,\n      what <i>littérateur</i> of that day would not have given twice as much for\n      an “<i>Idée de Bon-Bon</i>” as for all the trash of “<i>Idées</i>” of all\n      the rest of the <i>savants?</i> Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no\n      other man had ransacked—had more than any other would have\n      entertained a notion of reading—had understood more than any other\n      would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while\n      he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert\n      “that his <i>dicta</i> evinced neither the purity of the Academy, nor the\n      depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his doctrines were by no\n      means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were\n      difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account of their\n      self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is\n      to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that\n      Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was indeed\n      not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian—nor did he,\n      like the modern Leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might be\n      employed in the invention of a <i>fricasée</i> or, <i>facili gradú</i>,\n      the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the\n      obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was\n      Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned <i>à priori</i>—He\n      reasoned also <i>à posteriori</i>. His ideas were innate—or\n      otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in\n      Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of <i>restaurateur</i>. I\n      would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling\n      his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of\n      their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in\n      which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his opinion\n      the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities\n      of the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the\n      Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all\n      events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind\n      and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of\n      gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the\n      metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man\n      has not a thousand?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they\n      were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in\n      other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues.\n      As regards one of these foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in\n      this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme <i>alto\n      relievo</i>—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general\n      disposition. He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.\n    </p>\n<pre>     {*1} MD\n</pre>\n<p>\n      Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means necessary to the\n      satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own\n      proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any\n      kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile\n      was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a\n      knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the\n      one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. At the\n      epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation,\n      there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,\n      upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ\n      widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes,\n      or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature;\n      stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at\n      leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague\n      longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil\n      for wise purposes of his own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy\n      our serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary\n      profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether\n      this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such\n      profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did\n      not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—nor do I. Yet\n      in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be\n      supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive\n      discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time,\n      his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had\n      its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du\n      Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would\n      sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over\n      Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had\n      it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the\n      peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded—but this was by\n      no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the\n      philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange\n      intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie\n      of his favorite German studies.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To enter the little <i>café</i> in the <i>cul-de-sac</i> Le Febre was, at the period of\n      our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man of\n      genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have told\n      you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore\n      to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His large\n      water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his\n      master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a\n      debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether\n      unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect\n      might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the\n      metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to say,\n      have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much in the\n      outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of\n      the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the\n      little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression—which\n      mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in\n      creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his\n      head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the\n      rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering\n      upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of\n      his acquirements—in its immensity a fitting habitation for his\n      immortal soul.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter of\n      habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I\n      might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over\n      his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and\n      tassels—that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those\n      worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—that the\n      sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted—that\n      the cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with\n      cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more\n      fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his\n      slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been\n      manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the\n      brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—that his breeches were\n      of the yellow satin-like material called aimable—that his sky-blue\n      cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all\n      over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a\n      mist of the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the\n      remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that it\n      was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise,\n      or rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say, expatiate upon\n      all these points if I pleased,—but I forbear, merely personal\n      details may be left to historical novelists,—they are beneath the\n      moral dignity of matter-of-fact.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have said that “to enter the <i>café</i> in the <i>cul-de-sac</i> Le Febre was to\n      enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but then it was only the man\n      of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the <i>sanctum</i>. A sign,\n      consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of the\n      volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a <i>paté</i>. On the back were\n      visible in large letters <i>Œuvres de Bon-Bon</i>. Thus was delicately shadowed\n      forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building\n      presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique\n      construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the <i>café</i>. In a\n      corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army of\n      curtains, together with a canopy <i>à la Grècque</i>, gave it an air at once\n      classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in\n      direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the\n      <i>bibliotheque</i>. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here\n      lay an ovenful of the latest ethics—there a kettle of dudecimo\n      <i>mélanges</i>. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron—a\n      toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato\n      reclined at his ease in the frying-pan—and contemporary manuscripts\n      were filed away upon the spit.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In other respects the <i>Café de Bon-Bon</i> might be said to differ little from\n      the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door.\n      On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable\n      array of labelled bottles.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe\n      winter of ——, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having listened to\n      the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity—that\n      Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked\n      the door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific\n      mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of\n      blazing fagots.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice\n      during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre\n      with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall,\n      and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of\n      the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and\n      papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the\n      tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its\n      stanchions of solid oak.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his\n      chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a\n      perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of\n      his meditations. In attempting <i>des oeufs à la Princesse</i>, he had\n      unfortunately perpetrated an <i>omelette à la Reine;</i> the discovery of a\n      principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and\n      last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains\n      which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a\n      successful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these\n      unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree\n      of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well\n      calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large\n      black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in\n      his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those\n      distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the\n      red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming.\n      Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible\n      to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and\n      papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous\n      manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,\n      Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the\n      table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Very true,” calmly replied the voice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here?” vociferated\n      the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at\n      full length upon the bed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the\n      interrogatives,—“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time—that\n      the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing\n      importance—in short, that I can very well wait until you have\n      finished your Exposition.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My Exposition!—there now!—how do you know?—how came you\n      to understand that I was writing an Exposition?—good God!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly\n      from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp\n      that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the\n      stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly\n      lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,\n      by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,\n      but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These\n      garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their\n      present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches.\n      In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to\n      the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head\n      was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from\n      which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles,\n      with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and\n      at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color\n      or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a\n      shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme\n      precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by\n      side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an\n      ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and\n      demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over\n      his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an\n      instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of\n      his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps\n      of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly\n      from the person as to discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white\n      letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine—even\n      cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the\n      ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an\n      expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of\n      the hands, as he stepped toward our hero—a deep sigh—and\n      altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be\n      unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the\n      countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory\n      survey of his visitor’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\n      conducted him to a seat.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous\n      transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which\n      might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre\n      Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was\n      of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of\n      exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men\n      and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real\n      character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To\n      say no more, the conformation of his visitor’s feet was sufficiently\n      remarkable—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall\n      hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his\n      breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.\n      Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself\n      thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all\n      times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much\n      of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in\n      regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all\n      conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading\n      his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas,\n      which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,\n      enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas\n      which, I should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known\n      proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to\n      afford.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down,\n      while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and\n      place upon the now re-established table some bottles of <i>Mousseux</i>. Having\n      quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair <i>vis-à-vis</i> to his\n      companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. But\n      plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of\n      their application—and the <i>restaurateur</i> found himself <i>nonplussed</i> by\n      the very first words of his visitor’s speech.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi!\n      hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and the devil, dropping\n      at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth\n      from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,\n      and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and\n      uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,\n      joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent,\n      stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh\n      like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the\n      cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white\n      letters which formed the words “<i>Rituel Catholique</i>” on the book in his\n      guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and\n      in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words <i>Régitre des\n      Condamnes</i> blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,\n      when Bon-Bon replied to his visitor’s remark, imparted to his manner an\n      air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been\n      observed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak\n      sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the\n      d——dest—that is to say, I think—I imagine—I\n      <i>have</i> some faint—some <i>very</i> faint idea—of the\n      remarkable honor—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh!—ah!—yes!—very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say\n      no more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green\n      spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat,\n      and deposited them in his pocket.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement\n      was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to\n      view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain\n      the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had\n      anticipated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet\n      hazel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor\n      white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above, or\n      in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre\n      Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but\n      could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous\n      period—for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am\n      constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some\n      inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his\n      Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon—eyes! did you say?—oh!—ah!—I\n      perceive! The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given\n      you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!—true. Eyes, Pierre\n      Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is\n      the head?—right—the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these\n      optics are indispensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is\n      more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner—a\n      pretty cat—look at her—observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you\n      behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I say,—the ideas—the\n      reflections—which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it\n      is, now—you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her tail\n      and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most\n      distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of\n      metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my\n      profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable\n      at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I\n      allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use\n      them well;—my vision is the soul.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring\n      out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and\n      make himself perfectly at home.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our\n      friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after\n      a thorough compliance with his visitor’s injunction. “A clever book that\n      of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your arrangement\n      of the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many of your\n      notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most\n      intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper,\n      as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth\n      in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out of pure\n      compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you very well\n      know to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Cannot say that I—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men\n      expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the\n      metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux,\n      and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visitor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly\n      declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied—“there\n      was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a\n      friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons.\n      He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was\n      distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that δ\n      υοῦς εστιν\n      αυλος. He said that he would do so, and went\n      home, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me\n      for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to\n      Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing\n      the ‘αυλος.’\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So\n      the sentence now read ‘δ\n      υοῦς εστιν\n      αυγος’, and is, you perceive, the\n      fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Were you ever at Rome?” asked the <i>restaurateur</i>, as he finished his second\n      bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of\n      Chambertin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,\n      as if reciting some passage from a book—“there was a time when\n      occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of\n      all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people,\n      and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power—at\n      that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only I was in Rome, and I\n      have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.”\n       (*2)\n    </p>\n<pre>     {*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (<i>Cicero, Lucretius,\n     Seneca</i>) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.—<i>Condorcet</i>.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      “What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup!—Epicurus?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot\n      surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of Epicurus!\n      Do you mean me, sir?—I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher who\n      wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes\n      Laertes.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little\n      into his head.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Very well!—very well, sir!—very well, indeed, sir!” said his\n      Majesty, apparently much flattered.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a—hiccup!—a\n      lie!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and\n      Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to\n      conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As I was saying,” resumed the visitor—“as I was observing a little\n      while ago, there are some very <i>outré</i> notions in that book of yours\n      Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about\n      the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to\n      his MS., “is undoubtedly—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Indubitably—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Indisputably—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Evidently—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Incontrovertibly—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hiccup!—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And beyond all question, a—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking\n      daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle\n      of Chambertin.)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Then—hic-cup!—pray, sir—what—what is it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,\n      musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say, I have known some very bad\n      souls, and some too—pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips,\n      and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,\n      was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He continued.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristophanes—racy:\n      Plato—exquisite—not <i>your</i> Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your\n      Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus—faugh! Then let me\n      see! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then\n      there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,—dear\n      Quinty! as I called him when he sung a <i>seculare</i> for my amusement, while I\n      toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want <i>flavor</i>, these\n      Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will <i>keep</i>,\n      which cannot be said of a Quirite. Let us taste your Sauterne.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to the <i>nil admirari</i> and endeavored\n      to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a\n      strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although\n      extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—simply\n      kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The visitor continued:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;—you know I am\n      fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to\n      my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of\n      Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus\n      Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a penchant, it\n      is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev—I\n      mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. Long\n      ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a\n      little rancid on account of the gall!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Shelled!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I mean taken out of the carcass.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Don’t mention them!—ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched\n      violently.) “I never tasted but one—that rascal Hippocrates!—smelt\n      of asafoetida—ugh! ugh! ugh!—caught a wretched cold washing\n      him in the Styx—and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the—hic-cup!—abortion\n      of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher dropped a tear.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “After all,” continued the visitor, “after all, if a dev—if a\n      gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and\n      with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How so?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know\n      that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep\n      a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless\n      pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will—smell—you\n      understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls\n      are consigned to us in the usual way.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hiccup!—hiccup!—good God! how do you manage?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the\n      devil half started from his seat;—however, with a slight sigh, he\n      recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I tell\n      you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough\n      comprehension and acquiescence, and the visitor continued.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some put\n      up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in\n      which case I find they keep very well.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But the body!—hiccup!—the body!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The body, the body—well, what of the body?—oh! ah! I\n      perceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I\n      have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties\n      never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and\n      Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a\n      thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the\n      latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why\n      isn’t there A——, now, who you know as well as I? Is\n      <i>he</i> not in possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who\n      writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily? Who—but stay! I\n      have his agreement in my pocket-book.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number\n      of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters\n      <i>Machi—Maza—Robesp</i>—with the words <i>Caligula, George,\n      Elizabeth</i>. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it\n      read aloud the following words:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to\n      specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I being\n      aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this\n      agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my\n      soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did\n      not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      {*4} Quere-Arouet?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon, he\n      was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a shadow;\n      Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed\n      shadow!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Only</i> think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow!” exclaimed our\n      hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of\n      his Majesty’s discourse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Only think of a hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now, damme!—hiccup!—humph!\n      If <i>I</i> would have been such a—hiccup!—nincompoop! <i>My</i> soul, Mr.—humph!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Your</i> soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, sir—hiccup!—<i>my</i> soul is—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What, sir?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>No</i> shadow, damme!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Did you mean to say—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Did you not intend to assert—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My soul is—hiccup!—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!—a—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What, sir?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Stew.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Soufflee.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Eh!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Fricassee.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Indeed!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you\n      have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his\n      Majesty upon the back.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time\n      rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hiccup!—e-h?” said the philosopher.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Have no funds on hand.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Besides, very unhandsome in me—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sir!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To take advantage of—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hiccup!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here the visitor bowed and withdrew—in what manner could not\n      precisely be ascertained—but in a well-concerted effort to discharge\n      a bottle at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended\n      from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the\n      lamp.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.10\"></a>SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.</h2>\n<p>\n      The <i>symposium</i> of the preceding evening had been a little too much\n      for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\n      Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it\n      occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful\n      of supper and go immediately to bed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than\n      a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there\n      can be no material objection to two. And really between two and three,\n      there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps, upon\n      four. My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded\n      two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\n      admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\n      without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\n      serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\n      the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\n      profound slumber forthwith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have completed\n      my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell,\n      and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.\n      In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife\n      thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran\n      thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n“Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive\nthis. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I\nhave gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination\nof the Mummy—you know the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it\nand open it, if desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of\ncourse. The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven\nto-night.\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n           “Yours, ever,<br>\n                   P<small>ONNONNER</small>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide\n      awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing\n      all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set\n      off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\n      with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\n      the moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur\n      Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\n      the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\n      The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\n      sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous\n      illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from\n      which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\n      illustrations—the walls being completely covered with fresco\n      paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich\n      patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\n      condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it—that is to say,\n      the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\n      subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the\n      complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely\n      the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once\n      that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet\n      long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was\n      oblong—not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to be\n      the wood of the sycamore (<i>platanus</i>), but, upon cutting into it, we\n      found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, <i>papier mache</i>,\n      composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings,\n      representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed\n      among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of\n      hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the\n      departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no\n      difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and\n      represented the word <i>Allamistakeo</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but\n      having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\n      coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\n      but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\n      the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\n      colors of the interior box.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\n      third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\n      particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\n      emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between the\n      second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting\n      accurately within the other.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We\n      had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\n      bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\n      made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\n      painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various\n      supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities,\n      with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as\n      portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head to foot was a\n      columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving\n      again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads,\n      diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the\n      scarabaeus, etc., with the winged globe. Around the small of the waist\n      was a similar collar or belt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\n      with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\n      smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n      (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very\n      beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too\n      determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\n      embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the\n      surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the\n      powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums\n      became apparent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which\n      the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.\n      No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened\n      mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it was customary to withdraw\n      through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body\n      was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,\n      when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\n      his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two\n      o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until\n      the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some\n      one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old\n      at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original,\n      and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths\n      in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither\n      the Egyptian.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\n      portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than\n      other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course,\n      gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with\n      the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a\n      hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night,\n      when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there\n      immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed\n      to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and\n      which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far\n      covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the <i>tunica albuginea</i>\n      remained visible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\n      obvious to all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\n      in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\n      the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of\n      the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\n      fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr.\n      Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk\n      Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his\n      way, upon all fours, under the table.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\n      of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\n      directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over\n      the outside of the exterior <i>os sesamoideum pollicis pedis</i>, and thus\n      got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we now\n      applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of\n      exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\n      bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\n      limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\n      which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\n      catapult, through a window into the street below.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We rushed out <i>en masse</i> to bring in the mangled remains of the\n      victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in\n      an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\n      than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with\n      vigor and with zeal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound\n      incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself,\n      laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the\n      wire.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the\n      effect electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked\n      very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in\n      the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the\n      fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth,\n      turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very\n      capital Egyptian, thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\n      your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\n      is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But\n      you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided\n      in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manor born—you, I say\n      who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\n      think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been\n      led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did\n      anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your\n      standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to\n      suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins,\n      and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to\n      the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\n      villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\n      under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\n      violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\n      things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\n      conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am at\n      a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the\n      other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the\n      age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now\n      usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and\n      impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly\n      natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.\n      However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party\n      betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any\n      thing had gone very especially wrong.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\n      out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands\n      into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively\n      red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar\n      of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb\n      into the left corner of his mouth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\n      at length, with a sneer, said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\n      not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of\n      the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his\n      left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\n      to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what\n      we all meant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\n      deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\n      afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his\n      very excellent speech.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\n      conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\n      Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\n      untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of\n      Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\n      the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\n      could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\n      images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\n      the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\n      sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr.\n      Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\n      comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a\n      bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\n      standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\n      forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the\n      mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\n      Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at\n      Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\n      consented to take off his own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly\n      upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and\n      disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\n      disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\n      individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for\n      it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were\n      now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation\n      intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\n      Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did\n      not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\n      apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the\n      company all round.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\n      repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We\n      sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square\n      inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\n      Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.\n      The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a\n      black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid\n      pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade,\n      a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,\n      patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of\n      whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between\n      the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was\n      some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of\n      the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be\n      dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a\n      comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the\n      spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\n      expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\n      still remaining alive.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\n      you were dead.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\n      seven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\n      in his dotage when he died.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\n      which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\n      misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since\n      he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age at\n      the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\n      still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\n      which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “In what?” said the Count.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to\n      answer, no doubt—but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\n      than the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\n      Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\n      five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\n      delightfully well.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\n      probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\n      infancy of Galvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\n      thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\n      and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should\n      be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of\n      the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, not altogether.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah, I perceive—a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\n      enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm\n      (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal\n      functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in its widest\n      sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.\n      I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in\n      the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the\n      animal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever\n      condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that\n      condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of\n      the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\n      distinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\n      Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is\n      the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\n      embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did\n      not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I\n      should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\n      inconvenient to live.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire\n      mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Beyond doubt.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\n      of the Egyptian gods.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “One of the Egyptian <i>what?”</i> exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its\n      feet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said\n      the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the earth has\n      ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were\n      with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or\n      media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be\n      more directly approached.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\n      Ponnonner.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that\n      among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the\n      Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\n      embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\n      purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\n      still remain in the tomb.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by ‘purposely\n      so embalmed’?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\n      through his eye-glass—for it was the first time I had ventured to\n      address him a direct question.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my\n      time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\n      extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\n      than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.\n      After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\n      described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\n      curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\n      science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In the\n      case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this\n      kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age\n      of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself\n      carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that\n      they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say\n      five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the expiration of this\n      time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of\n      hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena\n      for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole\n      herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc., which passed under\n      the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have\n      enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go\n      about with a lantern to discover his own book. When discovered, it was\n      never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it\n      was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work\n      immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience,\n      the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\n      lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\n      pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\n      preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand\n      gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir, but may\n      I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\n      the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\n      epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\n      usually found to be right?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to\n      be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\n      histories themselves;—that is to say, not one individual iota of\n      either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and\n      radically wrong.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\n      thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted\n      that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were\n      sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\n      Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\n      centuries before.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\n      explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\n      latter at length said, hesitatingly:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During\n      my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the\n      universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at\n      all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by\n      a man of many speculations, concerning the origin <i>of the human race;</i>\n      and by this individual, the very word <i>Adam</i> (or Red Earth), which\n      you make use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a generical\n      sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just\n      as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the\n      spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously\n      upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of\n      us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham,\n      first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of\n      Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The long duration of human life in your time, together with the\n      occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments,\n      must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and\n      conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are to\n      attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars\n      of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the\n      Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\n      somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science\n      do you allude?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\n      assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes,\n      which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had\n      flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly\n      forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible\n      tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban\n      savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\n      smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to\n      his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as\n      yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this\n      head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one\n      Plutarch de facie lunae.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\n      general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\n      queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\n      and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As for\n      the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\n      possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\n      style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this\n      question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\n      extraordinary way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\n      both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\n      York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\n      Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went\n      on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\n      referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\n      than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that\n      moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of\n      the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but\n      the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in\n      a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He recollected, however,\n      (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a\n      kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four\n      columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.\n      The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two\n      miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty,\n      and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well as he could\n      remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been\n      altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over,\n      within and without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to assert\n      that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built\n      within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred\n      of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at\n      Carnac was an insignificant little building after all. He (the Count),\n      however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity,\n      magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as\n      described by the Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever\n      been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\n      ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\n      course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\n      the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and\n      fifty feet in altitude.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\n      have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\n      little palace at Carnac.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of\n      Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\n      winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently\n      discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked\n      me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the\n      obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\n      attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and\n      read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear,\n      but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\n      his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it\n      never progressed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at\n      much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we\n      enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.\n      When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred\n      something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined\n      all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of\n      mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious\n      constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed\n      remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing\n      ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some\n      fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism\n      that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\n      Egyptian ignorance of steam.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\n      silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\n      elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and\n      demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern\n      steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de\n      Caus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\n      would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\n      and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\n      moderns in the all-important particular of dress.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and\n      then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to\n      his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended\n      itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said\n      any thing in the way of reply.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\n      with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a\n      gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\n      manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain. It was\n      not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\n      triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.\n      Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\n      mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to\n      bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\n      memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I shall\n      behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily sick of\n      this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced that\n      every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be\n      President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of\n      coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a\n      couple of hundred years.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.11\"></a>THE POETIC PRINCIPLE</h2>\n<p>\n      In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either\n      thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the\n      essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite\n      for consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which\n      best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most\n      definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course, poems of little\n      length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard\n      to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully,\n      has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I\n      hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, “a long\n      poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in terms.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it\n      excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of\n      this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal\n      necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem\n      to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of\n      any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it\n      flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in\n      effect, and in fact, no longer such.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\n      critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly admired\n      throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during\n      perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand.\n      This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing\n      sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it\n      merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its\n      totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary)\n      at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of\n      excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true\n      poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no\n      critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the\n      work, we read it again, omitting the first book—that is to say,\n      commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that\n      admirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had\n      previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,\n      aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a\n      nullity:—and this is precisely the fact.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good\n      reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the\n      epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect\n      sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but\n      an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic\n      anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem <i>were </i>popular\n      in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem\n      will ever be popular again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That the extent of a poetical work is, <i>ceteris paribus, </i>the measure\n      of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition\n      sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly\n      Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere <i>size, </i>abstractly\n      considered—there can be nothing in mere <i>bulk, so </i>far as a\n      volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from\n      these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment\n      of physical magnitude which it conveys, <i>does </i>impress us with a\n      sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after <i>this </i>fashion\n      by the material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the Quarterlies\n      have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As <i>yet, </i>they have\n      not <i>insisted </i>on our estimating “Lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or\n      Pollock by the pound—but what else are we to <i>infer </i>from their\n      continual plating about “sustained effort”? If, by “sustained effort,” any\n      little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for\n      the effort—if this indeed be a thing conk mendable—but let us\n      forbear praising the epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that\n      common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art\n      rather by the impression it makes—by the effect it produces—than\n      by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained\n      effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The\n      fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor\n      can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this\n      proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as\n      self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities,\n      they will not be essentially damaged as truths.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue\n      brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now\n      and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or\n      enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon\n      the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and\n      spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp\n      themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers\n      of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem,\n      in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following\n      exquisite little Serenade—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nI arise from dreams of thee<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first sweet sleep of night,<br>\nWhen the winds are breathing low,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars are shining bright.<br>\nI arise from dreams of thee,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a spirit in my feet<br>\nHas led me—who knows how?—<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thy chamber-window, sweet!<br>\n<br>\nThe wandering airs they faint<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dark the silent stream—<br>\nThe champak odors fail<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sweet thoughts in a dream;<br>\nThe nightingale’s complaint,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It dies upon her heart,<br>\nAs I must die on shine,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, beloved as thou art!<br>\n<br>\nO, lift me from the grass!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I die, I faint, I fail!<br>\nLet thy love in kisses rain<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my lips and eyelids pale.<br>\nMy cheek is cold and white, alas!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart beats loud and fast:<br>\nO, press it close to shine again,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it will break at last.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines—yet no less a poet\n      than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal\n      imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by\n      him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\n      the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One of the finest poems by Willis—the very best in my opinion which\n      he has ever written—has no doubt, through this same defect of undue\n      brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the\n    </p>\n<pre>     The shadows lay along Broadway,\n         ’Twas near the twilight-tide—\n     And slowly there a lady fair\n         Was walking in her pride.\n     Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,\n         Walk’d spirits at her side.\n\n     Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,\n         And Honor charm’d the air;\n     And all astir looked kind on her,\n         And called her good as fair—\n     For all God ever gave to her\n         She kept with chary care.\n\n     She kept with care her beauties rare\n         From lovers warm and true—\n     For heart was cold to all but gold,\n         And the rich came not to won,\n     But honor’d well her charms to sell.\n         If priests the selling do.\n\n     Now walking there was one more fair—\n         A slight girl, lily-pale;\n     And she had unseen company\n         To make the spirit quail—\n     ’Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,\n         And nothing could avail.\n\n     No mercy now can clear her brow\n         From this world’s peace to pray\n     For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,\n         Her woman’s heart gave way!—\n     But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven\n         By man is cursed alway!\n</pre>\n<p>\n      In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has\n      written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not only richly\n      ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident\n      sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other\n      works of this author.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is\n      indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the\n      public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a\n      heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the\n      brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more\n      in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies\n      combined. I allude to the heresy of <i>The Didactic. </i>It has been\n      assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate\n      object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a\n      morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged.\n      We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians\n      very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads\n      that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge such\n      to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting\n      in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is that\n      would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should\n      immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor <i>can\n      </i>exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than\n      this very poem, this poem <i>per se, </i>this poem which is a poem and\n      nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I\n      would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I\n      would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The\n      demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All <i>that\n      </i>which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all <i>that </i>with\n      which <i>she </i>has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a\n      flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth\n      we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple,\n      precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must\n      be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the\n      poetical. <i>He </i>must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical\n      and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of\n      inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of\n      these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the\n      obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\n      distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I\n      place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the\n      mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but\n      from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle\n      has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues\n      themselves. Nevertheless we find the <i>offices </i>of the trio marked\n      with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with\n      Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is\n      regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the\n      obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with\n      displaying the charms:—waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of\n      her deformity—her disproportion—her animosity to the fitting,\n      to the appropriate, to the harmonious—in a word, to Beauty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense\n      of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the\n      manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists.\n      And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in\n      the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and\n      sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the\n      light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing,\n      with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of\n      description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and\n      sentiments which greet <i>him </i>in common with all mankind—he, I\n      say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something\n      in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst\n      unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This\n      thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and\n      an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for\n      the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild\n      effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of\n      the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among\n      the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness\n      whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by\n      Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find\n      ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina\n      supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant,\n      impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at\n      once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which <i>through’\n      </i>the poem, or <i>through </i>the music, we attain to but brief and\n      indeterminate glimpses.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on\n      the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all\n      <i>that </i>which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to\n      understand and <i>to feel </i>as poetic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in\n      Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very\n      especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in\n      the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has\n      regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly\n      on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music,\n      in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment\n      in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an\n      adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not\n      now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps\n      that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired\n      by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal\n      Beauty. It <i>may </i>be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and\n      then, attained in <i>fact. </i>We are often made to feel, with a shivering\n      delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which <i>cannot </i>have\n      been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in\n      the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the\n      widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers\n      had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his\n      own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words\n      as <i>The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. </i>Its sole arbiter is Taste.\n      With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral\n      relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with\n      Duty or with Truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A few words, however, in explanation. <i>That </i>pleasure which is at\n      once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived,\n      I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation\n      of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation,\n      or excitement <i>of the soul, </i>which we recognize as the Poetic\n      Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the\n      satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of\n      the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of\n      the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because\n      it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as\n      directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been\n      weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least <i>most\n      readily </i>attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that\n      the incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons\n      of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they\n      may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the\n      work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper\n      subjection to that <i>Beauty </i>which is the atmosphere and the real\n      essence of the poem.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your\n      consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s “Waif”:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     The day is done, and the darkness\n         Falls from the wings of Night,\n     As a feather is wafted downward\n         From an Eagle in his flight.\n\n     I see the lights of the village\n         Gleam through the rain and the mist,\n     And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,\n         That my soul cannot resist;\n\n     A feeling of sadness and longing,\n         That is not akin to pain,\n     And resembles sorrow only\n         As the mist resembles the rain.\n\n     Come, read to me some poem,\n         Some simple and heartfelt lay,\n     That shall soothe this restless feeling,\n         And banish the thoughts of day.\n\n     Not from the grand old masters,\n         Not from the bards sublime,\n     Whose distant footsteps echo\n         Through the corridors of Time.\n\n     For, like strains of martial music,\n         Their mighty thoughts suggest\n     Life’s endless toil and endeavor;\n         And to-night I long for rest.\n\n     Read from some humbler poet,\n         Whose songs gushed from his heart,\n     As showers from the clouds of summer,\n         Or tears from the eyelids start;\n\n     Who through long days of labor,\n         And nights devoid of ease,\n     Still heard in his soul the music\n         Of wonderful melodies.\n\n     Such songs have power to quiet\n         The restless pulse of care,\n     And come like the benediction\n         That follows after prayer.\n\n     Then read from the treasured volume\n         The poem of thy choice,\n     And lend to the rhyme of the poet\n         The beauty of thy voice.\n\n     And the night shall be filled with music,\n         And the cares that infest the day\n     Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,\n         And as silently steal away.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired\n      for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.\n      Nothing can be better than—\n    </p>\n<pre>    ———————the bards sublime,\n         Whose distant footsteps echo\n     Down the corridors of Time.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the\n      whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful <i>insouciance\n      </i>of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the\n      sentiments, and especially for the <i>ease </i>of the general manner. This\n      “ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion\n      to regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of really difficult\n      attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is difficult only to him\n      who should never meddle with it—to the unnatural. It is but the\n      result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that <i>the\n      tone, </i>in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind\n      would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion.\n      The author who, after the fashion of “The North American Review,” should\n      be upon <i>all </i>occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon <i>many\n      </i>occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be\n      considered “easy” or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the\n      sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one\n      which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     There, through the long, long summer hours,\n         The golden light should lie,\n     And thick young herbs and groups of flowers\n         Stand in their beauty by.\n     The oriole should build and tell\n     His love-tale, close beside my cell;\n         The idle butterfly\n     Should rest him there, and there be heard\n     The housewife-bee and humming bird.\n\n     And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,\n         Come, from the village sent,\n     Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,\n         With fairy laughter blent?\n     And what if, in the evening light,\n     Betrothed lovers walk in sight\n         Of my low monument?\n     I would the lovely scene around\n     Might know no sadder sight nor sound.\n\n     I know, I know I should not see\n         The season’s glorious show,\n     Nor would its brightness shine for me;\n         Nor its wild music flow;\n     But if, around my place of sleep,\n     The friends I love should come to weep,\n         They might not haste to go.\n     Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,\n     Should keep them lingering by my tomb.\n\n     These to their soften’d hearts should bear\n         The thoughts of what has been,\n     And speak of one who cannot share\n         The gladness of the scene;\n     Whose part in all the pomp that fills\n     The circuit of the summer hills,\n         Is—that his grave is green;\n     And deeply would their hearts rejoice\n     To hear again his living voice.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more\n      melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The\n      intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all\n      the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the\n      soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The\n      impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining\n      compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a\n      similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know\n      not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the\n      higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,\n    </p>\n<pre>     A feeling of sadness and longing\n         That is not akin to pain,\n     And resembles sorrow only\n         As the mist resembles the rain.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\n      of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate Pinckney:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     I fill this cup to one made up\n         Of loveliness alone,\n     A woman, of her gentle sex\n         The seeming paragon;\n     To whom the better elements\n         And kindly stars have given\n     A form so fair that, like the air,\n         ’Tis less of earth than heaven.\n\n     Her every tone is music’s own,\n         Like those of morning birds,\n     And something more than melody\n         Dwells ever in her words;\n     The coinage of her heart are they,\n         And from her lips each flows\n     As one may see the burden’d bee\n         Forth issue from the rose.\n\n     Affections are as thoughts to her,\n         The measures of her hours;\n     Her feelings have the flagrancy,\n         The freshness of young flowers;\n     And lovely passions, changing oft,\n         So fill her, she appears\n     The image of themselves by turns,—\n         The idol of past years!\n\n     Of her bright face one glance will trace\n         A picture on the brain,\n     And of her voice in echoing hearts\n         A sound must long remain;\n     But memory, such as mine of her,\n         So very much endears,\n     When death is nigh my latest sigh\n         Will not be life’s, but hers.\n\n     I fill’d this cup to one made up\n         Of loveliness alone,\n     A woman, of her gentle sex\n         The seeming paragon—\n     Her health! and would on earth there stood,\n         Some more of such a frame,\n     That life might be all poetry,\n         And weariness a name.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had\n      he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as\n      the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long\n      controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing\n      called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is especially\n      beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly\n      to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the\n      evident earnestness with which they are uttered.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the <i>merits\n      </i>of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for\n      themselves. Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us\n      that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very\n      admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the\n      work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing\n      this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out <i>all\n      the chaff </i>for his reward.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by\n      no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that\n      the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.\n      Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an\n      axiom, which need only be properly <i>put, </i>to become self-evident. It\n      is <i>not </i>excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:—and\n      thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to\n      admit that they are <i>not </i>merits altogether.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character\n      as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude\n      to his lines beginning—“Come, rest in this bosom.” The intense\n      energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There\n      are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the <i>all\n      in all </i>of the divine passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps,\n      has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any\n      other single sentiment ever embodied in words:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer\n     Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;\n     Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,\n     And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.\n\n     Oh! what was love made for, if ’tis not the same\n     Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?\n     I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,\n     I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.\n\n     Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,\n     And thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,—\n     Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,\n     And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!\n</pre>\n<p>\n      It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while\n      granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than\n      whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact\n      is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other\n      faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very\n      naturally, the idea that he is fanciful <i>only. </i>But never was there a\n      greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.\n      In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more\n      profoundly—more weirdly <i>imaginative, </i>in the best sense, than\n      the lines commencing—“I would I were by that dim lake”—which\n      are the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to\n      remember them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most\n      singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines” had\n      always for me an inexpressible charm:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     O saw ye not fair Ines?\n         She’s gone into the West,\n     To dazzle when the sun is down,\n         And rob the world of rest;\n     She took our daylight with her,\n         The smiles that we love best,\n     With morning blushes on her cheek,\n         And pearls upon her breast.\n\n     O turn again, fair Ines,\n         Before the fall of night,\n     For fear the moon should shine alone,\n         And stars unrivalltd bright;\n     And blessed will the lover be\n         That walks beneath their light,\n     And breathes the love against thy cheek\n         I dare not even write!\n\n     Would I had been, fair Ines,\n         That gallant cavalier,\n     Who rode so gaily by thy side,\n         And whisper’d thee so near!\n     Were there no bonny dames at home\n         Or no true lovers here,\n     That he should cross the seas to win\n         The dearest of the dear?\n\n     I saw thee, lovely Ines,\n         Descend along the shore,\n     With bands of noble gentlemen,\n         And banners waved before;\n     And gentle youth and maidens gay,\n         And snowy plumes they wore;\n     It would have been a beauteous dream,\n         If it had been no more!\n\n     Alas, alas, fair Ines,\n         She went away with song,\n     With music waiting on her steps,\n         And shootings of the throng;\n     But some were sad and felt no mirth,\n         But only Music’s wrong,\n     In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,\n         To her you’ve loved so long.\n\n     Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,\n         That vessel never bore\n     So fair a lady on its deck,\n         Nor danced so light before,—\n     Alas for pleasure on the sea,\n         And sorrow on the shorel\n     The smile that blest one lover’s heart\n         Has broken many more!\n</pre>\n<p>\n      “The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever\n      written,—one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of\n      the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It\n      is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative. I regret that its length\n      renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it\n      permit me to offer the universally appreciated “Bridge of Sighs”:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     One more Unfortunate,\n     Weary of breath,\n     Rashly importunate\n     Gone to her death!\n\n     Take her up tenderly,\n     Lift her with care;—\n     Fashion’d so slenderly,\n     Young and so fair!\n\n     Look at her garments\n     Clinging like cerements;\n     Whilst the wave constantly\n     Drips from her clothing;\n     Take her up instantly,\n     Loving not loathing.\n\n     Touch her not scornfully;\n     Think of her mournfully,\n     Gently and humanly;\n     Not of the stains of her,\n     All that remains of her\n     Now is pure womanly.\n\n     Make no deep scrutiny\n     Into her mutiny\n     Rash and undutiful;\n     Past all dishonor,\n     Death has left on her\n     Only the beautiful.\n\n     Where the lamps quiver\n     So far in the river,\n     With many a light\n     From window and casement\n     From garret to basement,\n     She stood, with amazement,\n     Houseless by night.\n\n     The bleak wind of March\n     Made her tremble and shiver,\n     But not the dark arch,\n     Or the black flowing river:\n     Mad from life’s history,\n     Glad to death’s mystery,\n     Swift to be hurl’d—\n     Anywhere, anywhere\n     Out of the world!\n\n     In she plunged boldly,\n     No matter how coldly\n     The rough river ran,—\n     Over the brink of it,\n     Picture it,—think of it,\n     Dissolute Man!\n     Lave in it, drink of it\n     Then, if you can!\n\n     Still, for all slips of hers,\n     One of Eve’s family—\n     Wipe those poor lips of hers\n     Oozing so clammily,\n     Loop up her tresses\n     Escaped from the comb,\n     Her fair auburn tresses;\n     Whilst wonderment guesses\n     Where was her home?\n\n     Who was her father?\n     Who was her mother?\n     Had she a sister?\n     Had she a brother?\n     Or was there a dearer one\n     Still, and a nearer one\n     Yet, than all other?\n\n     Alas! for the rarity\n     Of Christian charity\n     Under the sun!\n     Oh! it was pitiful!\n     Near a whole city full,\n     Home she had none.\n\n     Sisterly, brotherly,\n     Fatherly, motherly,\n     Feelings had changed:\n     Love, by harsh evidence,\n     Thrown from its eminence;\n     Even God’s providence\n     Seeming estranged.\n\n     Take her up tenderly;\n     Lift her with care;\n     Fashion’d so slenderly,\n     Young, and so fair!\n     Ere her limbs frigidly\n     Stiffen too rigidly,\n     Decently,—kindly,—\n     Smooth and compose them;\n     And her eyes, close them,\n     Staring so blindly!\n\n     Dreadfully staring\n     Through muddy impurity,\n     As when with the daring\n     Last look of despairing\n     Fixed on futurity.\n\n     Perhishing gloomily,\n     Spurred by contumely,\n     Cold inhumanity,\n     Burning insanity,\n     Into her rest,—\n     Cross her hands humbly,\n     As if praying dumbly,\n     Over her breast!\n     Owning her weakness,\n     Her evil behavior,\n     And leaving, with meekness,\n     Her sins to her Saviour!\n</pre>\n<p>\n      The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The\n      versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\n      fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is\n      the thesis of the poem.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from\n      the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     Though the day of my destiny’s over,\n         And the star of my fate bath declined\n     Thy soft heart refused to discover\n         The faults which so many could find;\n     Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,\n         It shrunk not to share it with me,\n     And the love which my spirit bath painted\n         It never bath found but in <i>thee.</i>\n\n     Then when nature around me is smiling,\n         The last smile which answers to mine,\n     I do not believe it beguiling,\n         Because it reminds me of shine;\n     And when winds are at war with the ocean,\n         As the breasts I believed in with me,\n     If their billows excite an emotion,\n         It is that they bear me from <i>thee.</i>\n\n     Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,\n         And its fragments are sunk in the wave,\n     Though I feel that my soul is delivered\n         To pain—it shall not be its slave.\n     There is many a pang to pursue me:\n         They may crush, but they shall not contemn—\n     They may torture, but shall not subdue me—\n         ’Tis of <i>thee </i>that I think—not of them.\n\n     Though human, thou didst not deceive me,\n         Though woman, thou didst not forsake,\n     Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,\n         Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—\n     Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,\n         Though parted, it was not to fly,\n     Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me,\n         Nor mute, that the world might belie.\n\n     Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,\n         Nor the war of the many with one—\n     If my soul was not fitted to prize it,\n         ’Twas folly not sooner to shun:\n     And if dearly that error bath cost me,\n         And more than I once could foresee,\n     I have found that whatever it lost me,\n         It could not deprive me of <i>thee.</i>\n\n     From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,\n         Thus much I at least may recall,\n     It bath taught me that which I most cherished\n         Deserved to be dearest of all:\n     In the desert a fountain is springing,\n         In the wide waste there still is a tree,\n     And a bird in the solitude singing,\n        Which speaks to my spirit of <i>thee.</i>\n</pre>\n<p>\n      Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification\n      could scarcely be improved. No nobler <i>theme </i>ever engaged the pen of\n      poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself\n      entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the\n      unwavering love of woman.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the\n      noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very\n      brief specimen. I call him, and <i>think </i>him the noblest of poets, <i>not\n      </i>because the impressions he produces are at <i>all </i>times the most\n      profound—<i>not </i>because the poetical excitement which he induces\n      is at <i>all </i>times the most intense—but because it is at all\n      times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most\n      pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read\n      is from his last long poem, “The Princess”:—\n    </p>\n<pre>         Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\n     Tears from the depth of some divine despair\n     Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\n     In looking on the happy Autumn fields,\n     And thinking of the days that are no more.\n\n         Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\n     That brings our friends up from the underworld,\n     Sad as the last which reddens over one\n     That sinks with all we love below the verge;\n     So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\n\n         Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\n     The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds\n     To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\n     The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\n     So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\n\n         Dear as remember’d kisses after death,\n     And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d\n     On lips that are for others; deep as love,\n     Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\n     O Death in Life, the days that are no more.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored\n      to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my\n      purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and\n      simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the\n      Principle is always found in <i>an elevating excitement of the soul, </i>quite\n      independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of\n      that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to\n      passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul.\n      Love, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the\n      Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably\n      the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if,\n      to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a\n      harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true\n      poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and\n      not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the\n      harmony manifest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what\n      the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements\n      which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the\n      ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in\n      the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in\n      the waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in\n      the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in\n      the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in\n      the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of\n      lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of\n      Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice\n      of the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the\n      fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the\n      voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that\n      comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim\n      oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts—in\n      all unworldly motives—in all holy impulses—in all chivalrous,\n      generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman—in\n      the grace of her step—in the lustre of her eye—in the melody\n      of her voice—in her soft laughter, in her sigh—in the harmony\n      of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning\n      endearments—in her burning enthusiasms—in her gentle charities—in\n      her meek and devotional endurances—but above all—ah, far above\n      all, he kneels to it—he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in\n      the strength, in the altogether divine majesty—of her love.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Let me conclude by—the recitation of yet another brief poem—one\n      very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by\n      Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our modern and\n      altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are\n      not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the\n      sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do\n      this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old\n      cavalier:—\n    </p>\n<pre>     Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,\n         And don your helmes amaine:\n     Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call\n         No shrewish teares shall fill your eye\n     When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,—\n         Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe\n     For the fayrest of the land;\n         Let piping swaine, and craven wight,\n     Thus weepe and poling crye,\n         Our business is like men to fight.\n</pre>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.12\"></a>OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)</h2>\n<p>\n      It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with\n      which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to\n      what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love\n      of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper <i>poetic\n      sentiment inspired</i>by their writings should be ascribed to a fact\n      which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and\n      with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a\n      merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout\n      admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,\n      would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,\n      wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being\n      required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be\n      apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This\n      quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the\n      case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and is\n      altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied.\n      Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in\n      many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have\n      worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. This is,\n      of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as against\n      the poets <i>thew. </i>There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old\n      English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned,\n      still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough\n      confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley\n      metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With\n      the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. The poet\n      of the “Creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he\n      supposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “Ancient Mariner” to infuse the\n      Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished\n      by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the\n      other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a\n      triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane\n      eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of\n      Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the\n      man. And he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well\n      designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up\n      in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very\n      perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their\n      writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that\n      soul’s nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this <i>abandon-to\n      elevate </i>immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle\n      the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the\n      lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a\n      matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be\n      found inferior to those results in one <i>(ceteris </i>paribus) more\n      artificial.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book of\n      Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\n      idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to\n      show the school’s character, the attempt might have been considered\n      successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of\n      the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their\n      antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us.\n      His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion,\n      for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on the Queen of Bohemia”—that\n      “there are few finer things in our language,” is untenable and absurd.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy\n      which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here\n      every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession\n      for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other\n      prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry,\n      a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched,\n      apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without\n      even an attempt at adaptation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The\n      Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers—a poem partaking, in a remarkable\n      degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.” Speaking of Poesy the\n      author says:\n    </p>\n<pre>     “By the murmur of a spring,\n     Or the least boughs rustleling,\n     By a daisy whose leaves spread,\n     Shut when Titan goes to bed,\n     Or a shady bush or tree,\n     She could more infuse in me\n     Than all Nature’s beauties can\n     In some other wiser man.\n     By her help I also now\n     Make this churlish place allow\n     Something that may sweeten gladness\n     In the very gall of sadness—\n     The dull loneness, the black shade,\n     That these hanging vaults have made\n     The strange music of the waves\n     Beating on these hollow caves,\n     This black den which rocks emboss,\n     Overgrown with eldest moss,\n     The rude portals that give light\n     More to terror than delight,\n     This my chamber of neglect\n\n     Walled about with disrespect;\n     From all these and this dull air\n     A fit object for despair,\n     She hath taught me by her might\n     To draw comfort and delight.”\n </pre>\n<p>\n      But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general\n      character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in\n      Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of Marvell’s “Maiden\n      lamenting for her Fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen of the\n      elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos,\n      exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of its\n      species:\n    </p>\n<pre>     “It is a wondrous thing how fleet\n     ’Twas on those little silver feet,\n     With what a pretty skipping grace\n     It oft would challenge me the race,\n     And when’t had left me far away\n     ’Twould stay, and run again, and stay;\n     For it was nimbler much than hinds,\n     And trod as if on the four winds.\n     I have a garden of my own,\n     But so with roses overgrown,\n     And lilies, that you would it guess\n     To be a little wilderness;\n     And all the spring-time of the year\n     It only loved to be there.\n     Among the beds of lilies I\n     Have sought it oft where it should lie,\n     Yet could not, till itself would rise,\n     Find it, although before mine eyes.\n     For in the flaxen lilies’ shade\n     It like a bank of lilies laid;\n     Upon the roses it would feed\n     Until its lips even seemed to bleed,\n     And then to me ’twould boldly trip,\n     And print those roses on my lip,\n     But all its chief delight was still\n     With roses thus itself to fill,\n     And its pure virgin limbs to fold\n     In whitest sheets of lilies cold.\n     Had it lived long, it would have been\n     Lilies without, roses within.”\n </pre>\n<p>\n      How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It\n      pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the\n      gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over\n      the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties\n      and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud\n      over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” The whole is\n      redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea\n      conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the\n      artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,\n      or the fragrance and warmth and <i>appropriateness </i>of the little\n      nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\n      them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\n      little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her\n      face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the\n      few lines we have quoted the <i>wonder </i>of the little maiden at the\n      fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”—the fawn\n      challenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running\n      on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to\n      fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How\n      exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And trod as if on the four winds!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\n      speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then\n      consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and\n      lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”—the fawn loving to be there,\n      and there “only”—the maiden seeking it “where it <i>should </i>lie”—and\n      not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would\n      rise”—the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”—the\n      loving to “fill itself with roses,”\n     </p>\n<pre>        “And its pure virgin limbs to fold\n        In whitest sheets of lilies cold,”\n </pre>\n<p>\n      and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent\n      beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only\n      renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the\n      artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate\n      admiration of the bereaved child—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      * “Book of Gems,” Edited by S.

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.16\"></a>THE RAVEN.</h2>\n<pre> Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\n Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\n While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\n                          Only this, and nothing more.”\n\n Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\n And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\n From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\n For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n                          Nameless here for evermore.\n\n And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n                          This it is, and nothing more.”\n\n Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door:——\n                          Darkness there and nothing more.\n\n Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\n And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”\n                          Merely this, and nothing more.\n\n Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\n Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n                          ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n\n Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\n Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\n But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\n Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\n                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\n Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\n Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\n Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n                          Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”\n\n Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\n For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\n Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n                         With such name as “Nevermore.”\n\n But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\n On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”\n                          Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n\n Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\n Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n                         Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”\n\n But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\n Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\n What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\n                         Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n\n This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o’er,\n But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,\n                          <i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\n Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent\n thee\n Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\n Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\n Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\n On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\n Is there—<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!\n By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\n Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\n Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\n                          Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n\n And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\n And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\n And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n                          Shall be lifted—nevermore!\n</pre>\n<p>\n      Published 1845.\n    </p>\n",

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.31\"></a>NOTES</h2>\n<p>\n      1. “The Raven” was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New\n      York “Evening Mirror”-a paper its author was then assistant editor of. It\n      was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N.\n      P. Willis: “We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the\n      second number of the “American Review,” the following remarkable poem by\n      Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of\n      ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in\n      English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification,\n      and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ It is\n      one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. It will stick to\n      the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the February number of the\n      “American Review” the poem was published as by “Quarles,” and it was\n      introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by\n      Poe himself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      [“The following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint strain\n      of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches\n      amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the\n      author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique\n      rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English\n      rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing\n      corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much\n      more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic\n      tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several\n      advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater\n      abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and very great advantages of\n      sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect\n      of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen\n      that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from alliteration, and the\n      studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its\n      measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they\n      might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon\n      form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in\n      the verse” (stanza?)—“which flows continuously, with only an\n      aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the\n      Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of\n      sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different\n      effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\n      better understood.”—ED. “Am. Rev.”]\n    </p>\n<p>\n      2. The bibliographical history of “The Bells” is curious. The subject, and\n      some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet’s\n      friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,\n      headed it, “The Bells, By Mrs. M. A. Shew.” This draft, now the editor’s\n      property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus:\n    </p>\n<pre>                       I.\n\n     The bells!-ah, the bells!\n     The little silver bells!\n     How fairy-like a melody there floats\n     From their throats—\n     From their merry little throats—\n     From the silver, tinkling throats\n     Of the bells, bells, bells—\n     Of the bells!\n\n                       II.\n\n     The bells!-ah, the bells!\n\n     The heavy iron bells!\n     How horrible a monody there floats\n     From their throats—\n     From their deep-toned throats—\n     From their melancholy throats!\n     How I shudder at the notes Of the bells, bells, bells—\n     Of the bells!\n</pre>\n<p>\n      In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to\n      the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the\n      following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much\n      enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without\n      publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version,\n      was sent, and in the following October was published in the “Union\n      Magazine.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      3. This poem was first published in Colton’s “American Review” for\n      December, 1847, as “To—Ulalume: a Ballad.” Being reprinted\n      immediately in the “Home Journal,” it was copied into various publications\n      with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to\n      him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza\n      which Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman, wisely\n      suppressed:\n    </p>\n<pre>     Said we then—we two, then—“Ah, can it\n     Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—\n     The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—\n     To bar up our path and to ban it\n     From the secret that lies in these wolds—\n     Had drawn up the spectre of a planet\n     From the limbo of lunary souls—\n     This sinfully scintillant planet\n     From the Hell of the planetary souls?”\n </pre>\n<p>\n      4. “To Helen” (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published until November,\n      1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the\n      “Union Magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or\n      desire of Poe, of the line, “Oh, God! oh, Heaven—how my heart beats\n      in coupling those two words.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      5. “Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression\n      of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one\n      of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a\n      copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in which publication it\n      appeared in January, 1850, three months after the author’s death. While\n      suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\n      “Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” who\n      published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe’s\n      death. In the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed\n      into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the\n      poem in an obituary of Poe, in the New York “Tribune,” before any one else\n      had an opportunity of publishing it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      6. “A Valentine,” one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to\n      have been written early in 1846.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      7. “An Enigma,” addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewis (“Stella”), was sent to\n      that lady in a letter, in November, 1847, and the following March appeared\n      in Sartain’s “Union Magazine.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      8. The sonnet, “To My Mother” (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to\n      the short-lived “Flag of our Union,” early in 1849, but does not appear\n      to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in\n      the “Leaflets of Memory” for 1850.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      9. “For Annie” was first published in the “Flag of our Union,” in the\n      spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly\n      afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “Home Journal.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      10. “To F——” (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the\n      “Broadway Journal” for April, 1845. These lines are but slightly varied\n      from those inscribed “To Mary,” in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for\n      July, 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed,\n      in “Graham’s Magazine” for March, 1842, as “To One Departed.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      11. “To F——s S. O—d,” a portion of the poet’s triune\n      tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the “Broadway Journal” for\n      September, 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the\n      “Southern Literary Messenger” for September, 1835, as “Lines written in an\n      Album,” and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor’s daughter.\n      Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton’s “Gentleman’s Magazine”\n       for August, 1839, as “To——.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      12. Although “Eldorado” was published during Poe’s lifetime, in 1849, in\n      the “Flag of our Union,” it does not appear to have ever received the\n      author’s finishing touches.\n    </p>\n",

Politian and Baldazzar.\n\n       Baldazzar.—Arouse thee now, Politian!\n  Thou must not—nay indeed, indeed, shalt not\n  Give away unto these humors. Be thyself!\n  Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,\n  And live, for now thou diest!\n\n       Politian.  Not so, Baldazzar! Surely I live.\n\n       Bal. Politian, it doth grieve me\n  To see thee thus.\n\n      Pol.  Baldazzar, it doth grieve me\n  To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend.\n  Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?\n  At thy behest I will shake off that nature\n  Which from my forefathers I did inherit,\n  Which with my mother’s milk I did imbibe,\n  And be no more Politian, but some other.\n  Command me, sir!\n\n      Bal.  To the field, then—to the field—\n  To the senate or the field.\n\n      Pol. Alas! Alas!\n  There is an imp would follow me even there!\n  There is an imp hath followed me even there!\n  There is—what voice was that?\n\n      Bal.  I heard it not.\n  I heard not any voice except thine own,\n  And the echo of thine own.\n\n      Pol.  Then I but dreamed.\n\n      Bal.  Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp—the court,\n  Befit thee—Fame awaits thee—Glory calls—\n  And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear\n  In hearkening to imaginary sounds\n  And phantom voices.\n\n      Pol.  It is a phantom voice!\n  Didst thou not hear it then?\n\n      Bal.  I heard it not.\n\n      Pol.  Thou heardst it not!—Baldazaar, speak no more\n  To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.\n  Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,\n  Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities\n  Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!\n  We have been boys together—schoolfellows—\n  And now are friends—yet shall not be so long—\n  For in the eternal city thou shalt do me\n  A kind and gentle office, and a Power—\n  A Power august, benignant and supreme—\n  Shall then absolve thee of all further duties\n  Unto thy friend.\n\n      Bal.  Thou speakest a fearful riddle\n  I will not understand.\n\n      Pol.  Yet now as Fate\n  Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,\n  The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,\n  And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!\n  I cannot die, having within my heart\n  So keen a relish for the beautiful\n  As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air\n  Is balmier now than it was wont to be—\n  Rich melodies are floating in the winds—\n  A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth—\n  And with a holier lustre the quiet moon\n  Sitteth in Heaven.—Hist! hist! thou canst not say\n  Thou hearest not now, Baldazzar?\n\n      Bal.  Indeed I hear not.\n\n      Pol.  Not hear it!—listen now!—listen!—the faintest sound\n  And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!\n  A lady’s voice!—and sorrow in the tone!\n  Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!\n  Again!—again!—how solemnly it falls\n  Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice\n  Surely I never heard—yet it were well\n  Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones\n  In earlier days!\n\n      Bal.  I myself hear it now.\n  Be still!—the voice, if I mistake not greatly,\n  Proceeds from yonder lattice—which you may see\n  Very plainly through the window—it belongs,\n  Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.\n  The singer is undoubtedly beneath\n  The roof of his Excellency—and perhaps\n  Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke\n  As the betrothed of Castiglione,\n  His son and heir.\n\n      Pol.  Be still!—it comes again!\n\n      Voice        “And is thy heart so strong\n  (very faintly)   As for to leave me thus\n              Who hath loved thee so long\n\n              In wealth and woe among?\n              And is thy heart so strong\n              As for to leave me thus?\n                  Say nay—say nay!”\n\n      Bal.  The song is English, and I oft have heard it\n  In merry England—never so plaintively—\n  Hist! hist! it comes again!\n\n      Voice            “Is it so strong\n  (more loudly)    As for to leave me thus\n              Who hath loved thee so long\n              In wealth and woe among?\n              And is thy heart so strong\n              As for to leave me thus?\n                  Say nay—say nay!”\n\n      Bal.  ’Tis hushed and all is still!\n\n      Pol.  All is not still!\n\n      Bal.  Let us go down.\n\n      Pol.  Go down, Baldazzar, go!\n\n      Bal.  The hour is growing late—the Duke awaits use—\n  Thy presence is expected in the hall\n  Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?\n\n      Voice           “Who hath loved thee so long\n  (distinctly)        In wealth and woe among,\n\n                          And is thy heart so strong?\n\n                               Say nay—say nay!”\n\n      Bal.  Let us descend!—’tis time. Politian, give\n  These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,\n  Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness\n  Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember\n\n      Pol.  Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.\n\n                                                  (going.)\n  Let us descend. Believe me I would give,\n  Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom\n  To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice—\n  “To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear\n  Once more that silent tongue.”\n\n      Bal.  Let me beg you, sir,\n  Descend with me—the Duke may be offended.\n  Let us go down, I pray you.\n\n      (Voice loudly) Say nay!—say nay!\n\n      Pol. (aside)  ’Tis strange!—’tis very strange—methought the\n  voice\n  Chimed in with my desires, and bade me stay!\n\n                                     (approaching the window.)\n  Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.\n  Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,\n  Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make\n  Apology unto the Duke for me;\n  I go not down to-night.\n\n      Bal.  Your lordship’s pleasure\n  Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.\n\n      Pol.  Good-night, my friend, good-night.\n\n                           IV.\n\n             The gardens of a Palace—Moonlight Lalage and Politian.\n\n      Lalge.  And dost thou speak of love\n  To me, Politian?—dost thou speak of love\n  To Lalage?—ah, woe—ah, woe is me!\n  This mockery is most cruel—most cruel indeed!\n\n      Politian.  Weep not! oh, sob not thus!—thy bitter tears\n  Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage—\n  Be comforted! I know—I know it all,\n  And still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest\n  And beautiful Lalage!—turn here thine eyes!\n  Thou askest me if I could speak of love,\n  Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen.\n  Thou askest me that—and thus I answer thee—\n  Thus on my bended knee I answer thee.                    (kneeling.)\n  Sweet Lalage, I love thee—love thee—love thee;\n  Thro’ good and ill—thro’ weal and wo I love thee.\n  Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,\n  Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.\n  Not on God’s altar, in any time or clime,\n  Burned there a holier fire than burneth now\n  Within my spirit for thee. And do I love?                 (arising.)\n  Even for thy woes I love thee—even for thy woes—\n  Thy beauty and thy woes.\n\n      Lal.  Alas, proud Earl,\n  Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!\n  How, in thy father’s halls, among the maidens\n  Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,\n  Could the dishonored Lalage abide?\n  Thy wife, and with a tainted memory—\n  MY seared and blighted name, how would it tally\n  With the ancestral honors of thy house,\n  And with thy glory?\n\n      Pol.  Speak not to me of glory!\n  I hate—I loathe the name; I do abhor\n  The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.\n  Art thou not Lalage and I Politian?\n  Do I not love—art thou not beautiful—\n  What need we more? Ha! glory!—now speak not of it.\n  By all I hold most sacred and most solemn—\n  By all my wishes now—my fears hereafter—\n  By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven—\n  There is no deed I would more glory in,\n  Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory\n  And trample it under foot. What matters it—\n  What matters it, my fairest, and my best,\n  That we go down unhonored and forgotten\n  Into the dust—so we descend together.\n  Descend together—and then—and then, perchance—\n\n      Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?\n\n      Pol.  And then, perchance\n  Arise together, Lalage, and roam\n  The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,\n  And still—\n\n      Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?\n\n      Pol.  And still together—together.\n\n      Lal.  Now Earl of Leicester!\n  Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts\n  I feel thou lovest me truly.\n\n      Pol.  Oh, Lalage!\n\n                                       (throwing himself upon his knee.)\n  And lovest thou me?\n\n      Lal.  Hist! hush! within the gloom\n  Of yonder trees methought a figure passed—\n  A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless—\n  Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.\n\n                                             (walks across and returns.)\n  I was mistaken—’twas but a giant bough\n  Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!\n\n      Pol.  My Lalage—my love! why art thou moved?\n  Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience’ self,\n  Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,\n  Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind\n  Is chilly—and these melancholy boughs\n  Throw over all things a gloom.\n\n      Lal.  Politian!\n  Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land\n  With which all tongues are busy—a land new found—\n  Miraculously found by one of Genoa—\n  A thousand leagues within the golden west?\n  A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,\n  And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,\n  And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds\n  Of Heaven untrammelled flow—which air to breathe\n  Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter\n  In days that are to come?\n\n      Pol.  O, wilt thou—wilt thou\n  Fly to that Paradise—my Lalage, wilt thou\n  Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,\n  And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.\n  And life shall then be mine, for I will live\n  For thee, and in thine eyes—and thou shalt be\n  No more a mourner—but the radiant Joys\n  Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope\n  Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee\n  And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,\n  My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,\n  My all;—oh, wilt thou—wilt thou, Lalage,\n  Fly thither with me?\n\n      Lal.  A deed is to be done—\n  Castiglione lives!\n\n      Pol.  And he shall die!                                (exit)\n\n      Lal. (after a pause.)  And—he—shall—die!—alas!\n  Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?\n  Where am I?—what was it he said?—Politian!\n  Thou art not gone—thou are not gone, Politian!\n  I feel thou art not gone—yet dare not look,\n  Lest I behold thee not; thou couldst not go\n  With those words upon thy lips—O, speak to me!\n  And let me hear thy voice—one word—one word,\n  To say thou art not gone,—one little sentence,\n  To say how thou dost scorn—how thou dost hate\n  My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone—\n  O speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!\n  I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.\n  Villain, thou art not gone—thou mockest me!\n  And thus I clutch thee—thus!—He is gone, he is gone\n  Gone—gone. Where am I?—’tis well—’tis very well!\n  So that the blade be keen—the blow be sure,\n  ’Tis well, ’tis very well—alas! alas!\n\n                            V.\n\n                 The suburbs. Politian alone.\n\n      Politian.  This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,\n  And much I fear me ill—it will not do\n  To die ere I have lived!—Stay, stay thy hand,\n  O Azrael, yet awhile!—Prince of the Powers\n  Of Darkness and the Tomb, O pity me!\n  O pity me! let me not perish now,\n  In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!\n  Give me to live yet—yet a little while:\n  ’Tis I who pray for life—I who so late\n  Demanded but to die!—what sayeth the Count?\n\n                    Enter Baldazzar.\n\n      Baldazzar.  That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud\n  Between the Earl Politian and himself.\n  He doth decline your cartel.\n\n      Pol.  What didst thou say?\n  What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?\n  With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes\n  Laden from yonder bowers!—a fairer day,\n  Or one more worthy Italy, methinks\n  No mortal eyes have seen!—what said the Count?\n\n      Bal.  That he, Castiglione’ not being aware\n  Of any feud existing, or any cause\n  Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,\n  Cannot accept the challenge.\n\n      Pol.  It is most true—\n  All this is very true. When saw you, sir,\n  When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid\n  Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,\n  A heaven so calm as this—so utterly free\n  From the evil taint of clouds?—and he did say?\n\n      Bal.  No more, my lord, than I have told you, sir:\n  The Count Castiglione will not fight,\n  Having no cause for quarrel.\n\n      Pol.  Now this is true—\n  All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,\n  And I have not forgotten it—thou’lt do me\n  A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say\n  Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,\n  Hold him a villain?—thus much, I prythee, say\n  Unto the Count—it is exceeding just\n  He should have cause for quarrel.\n\n      Bal.  My lord!—my friend!—\n\n      Pol.  (aside.) ’Tis he!—he comes himself? (aloud) Thou reasonest\n  well.\n  I know what thou wouldst say—not send the message—\n  Well!—I will think of it—I will not send it.\n  Now prythee, leave me—hither doth come a person\n  With whom affairs of a most private nature\n  I would adjust.\n\n      Bal.  I go—to-morrow we meet,\n  Do we not?—at the Vatican.\n\n      Pol.  At the Vatican.                                     (exit\n  Bal.)\n\n                    Enter Castigilone.\n\n      Cas.  The Earl of Leicester here!\n\n      Pol.  I am the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,\n  Dost thou not? that I am here.\n\n      Cas.  My lord, some strange,\n  Some singular mistake—misunderstanding—\n  Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged\n  Thereby, in heat of anger, to address\n  Some words most unaccountable, in writing,\n  To me, Castiglione; the bearer being\n  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware\n  Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,\n  Having given thee no offence. Ha!—am I right?\n  ’Twas a mistake?—undoubtedly—we all\n  Do err at times.\n\n      Pol.  Draw, villain, and prate no more!\n\n      Cas.  Ha!—draw?—and villain? have at thee then at once,\n  Proud Earl!                                   (draws.)\n\n      Pol.  (drawing.)  Thus to the expiatory tomb,\n  Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee\n  In the name of Lalage!\n\n      Cas.  (letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the\n  stage)\n\n                      Of Lalage!\n  Hold off—thy sacred hand!—avaunt, I say!\n  Avaunt—I will not fight thee—indeed I dare not.\n\n      Pol.  Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?\n  Shall I be baffled thus?—now this is well;\n  Didst say thou darest not? Ha!\n\n      Cas.  I dare not—dare not—\n  Hold off thy hand—with that beloved name\n  So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee—\n  I cannot—dare not.\n\n      Pol.  Now by my halidom\n  I do believe thee!—coward, I do believe thee!\n\n      Cas.  Ha!—coward!—this may not be!\n\n       (clutches his sword and staggers towards POLITIAN, but his purpose\n  is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of\n  the Earl)\n\n                             Alas! my lord,\n  It is—it is—most true. In such a cause\n  I am the veriest coward. O pity me!\n\n      Pol.  (greatly softened.)  Alas!—I do—indeed I pity thee.\n\n      Cas.  And Lalage—\n\n      Pol.  Scoundrel!—arise and die!\n\n      Cas.  It needeth not be—thus—thus—O let me die\n  Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting\n  That in this deep humiliation I perish.\n  For in the fight I will not raise a hand\n  Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home—\n\n                                                     (baring his bosom.)\n  Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon—\n  Strike home. I will not fight thee.\n\n      Pol.  Now, s’ Death and Hell!\n  Am I not—am I not sorely—grievously tempted\n  To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir,\n  Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare\n  For public insult in the streets—before\n  The eyes of the citizens. I’ll follow thee\n  Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee\n  Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest—\n  Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain,—I’ll taunt thee,\n  Dost hear? with cowardice—thou wilt not fight me?\n  Thou liest! thou shalt!                                      (exit.)\n\n      Cas.  Now this indeed is just!\n  Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!\n\n  {In the book there is a gap in numbering the notes between 12 and 29.\n —ED}\n</pre>\n<p>\n      NOTE\n    </p>\n<p>\n      29. Such portions of “Politian” as are known to the public first saw the\n      light of publicity in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for December,\n      1835, and January, 1836, being styled “Scenes from Politian: an\n      unpublished drama.” These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845\n      collection of Poems, by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft\n      subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not\n      considered just to the poet’s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty\n      and unrevised production of its author’s earlier days of literary labor;\n      and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his\n      reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the\n      following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The\n      Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of\n      Castiglione her betrothed.\n    </p>\n<pre>      Duke. Why do you laugh?\n\n      Castiglione. Indeed\n\n  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not\n  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\n  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.\n  Alessandra, you and 1, you must remember!\n  We were walking in the garden.\n\n      Duke, Perfectly.\n  I do remember it-what of it-what then?\n\n      Cas. O nothing-nothing at all.\n\n      Duke. Nothing at all!\n  It is most singular that you should laugh\n  ‘At nothing at all!\n\n      Cas. Most singular-singular!\n\n      Duke. Look you, Castiglione, be so kind\n  As tell me, sir, at once what ’tis you mean.\n  What are you talking of?\n\n      Cas. Was it not so?\n  We differed in opinion touching him.\n\n      Duke. Him!—Whom?\n\n      Cas. Why, sir, the Earl Politian.\n\n      Duke. The Earl of Leicester! Yes!—is it he you mean?\n  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect\n  The words you used were that the Earl you knew\n  Was neither learned nor mirthful.\n\n      Cas. Ha! ha!—now did I?\n\n      Duke. That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\n  You were wrong, it being not the character\n  Of the Earl-whom all the world allows to be\n  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\n  Too positive again.\n\n      Cas. ’Tis singular!\n  Most singular! I could not think it possible\n  So little time could so much alter one!\n  To say the truth about an hour ago,\n  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\n  All arm in arm, we met this very man\n  The Earl-he, with his friend Baldazzar,\n  Having just arrived in Rome. Hal ha! he is altered!\n  Such an account he gave me of his journey!\n  ’Twould have made you die with laughter-such tales he told\n  Of his caprices and his merry freaks\n  Along the road-such oddity-such humor—\n  Such wit-such whim-such flashes of wild merriment\n  Set off too in such full relief by the grave\n  Demeanor of his friend-who, to speak the truth,\n  Was gravity itself—\n\n      Duke. Did I not tell you?\n\n      Cas. You did-and yet ’tis strange! but true as strange,\n  How much I was mistaken! I always thought\n  The Earl a gloomy man.\n\n      Duke. So, so, you see! Be not too positive. Whom have we here?\n  It can not be the Earl?\n\n      Cas. The Earl! Oh, no! ’Tis not the Earl-but yet it is-and leaning\n  Upon his friend Baldazzar. AM welcome, sir!\n\n  (Enter Politian and Baldazzar.)\n  My lord, a second welcome let me give you\n  To Rome-his Grace the Duke of Broglio.\n  Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl\n  Of Leicester in Great Britain. [Politian bows haughtily.]\n      That, his friend\n  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,\n  So please you, for Your Grace.\n\n      Duke. Hal ha! Most welcome\n  To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!\n  And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!\n  I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.\n  Castiglione! call your cousin hither,\n  And let me make the noble Earl acquainted\n  With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time\n  Most seasonable. The wedding—\n\n      Politian. Touching those letters, sir,\n  Your son made mention of—your son, is he not?\n  Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.\n  If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here—\n  Baldazzar! ah!—my friend Baldazzar here\n  Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.\n\n      Duke. Retire!—So soon?\n\n  Came What ho! Benito! Rupert!\n  His lordship’s chambers-show his lordship to them!\n  His lordship is unwell.     (Enter Benito.)\n\n      Ben. This way, my lord! (Exit, followed by Politian.)\n\n      Duke. Retire! Unwell!\n\n      Bal. So please you, sir. I fear me\n  ’Tis as you say—his lordship is unwell.\n  The damp air of the evening-the fatigue\n  Of a long journey—the—indeed I had better\n  Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.\n  I will return anon.\n\n      Duke. Return anon!\n  Now this is very strange! Castiglione!\n  This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.\n  You surely were mistaken in what you said\n  Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!—which of us said\n  Politian was a melancholy man?

Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy\n      a second edition-that small portion I thought it as well to include in the\n      present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined\n      ‘Al Aaraaf’ and ‘Tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have\n      I hesitated to insert from the ‘Minor Poems,’ now omitted, whole lines,\n      and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the\n      trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some\n      chance of being seen by posterity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who\n      is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and <i>mine </i>of\n      poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the\n      critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few\n      B-’s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world’s good opinion\n      as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe,\n      ‘Shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and yet\n      Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge\n      correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’ The\n      difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or ‘opinion.’\n      The opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man\n      would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it\n      is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for\n      example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read\n      Shakespeare. But the fool’s neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of\n      the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far\n      above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean\n      his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means\n      of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never\n      have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great\n      poet—the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his <i>opinion.\n      </i>This neighbor’s own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one\n      above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel\n      around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands\n      upon the pinnacle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He\n      is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of\n      the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or\n      empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in\n      possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,\n      improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a\n      distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops\n      glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic\n      characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many\n      letters of recommendation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the\n      notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\n      another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would\n      be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I\n      grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his\n      little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not,\n      I think, fail of making-a just critique; whatever should be deducted on\n      the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate\n      acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false\n      criticism than of just where one’s own writings are the test, simply\n      because we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many\n      objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but\n      his opinion with respect to the ‘Paradise Regained’ is by no means fairly\n      ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert\n      what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended\n      to posterity. But, in fact, the ‘Paradise Regained’ is little, if at all,\n      inferior to the ‘Paradise Lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men\n      do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading\n      those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the\n      first to derive any pleasure from the second.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I dare say Milton preferred ‘Comus’ to either-. if so-justly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\n      the most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is\n      called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been\n      induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation\n      of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The\n      wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but,\n      being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most\n      philosophical of all writings*-but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce\n      it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or\n      should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence\n      is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence,\n      everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness.\n      Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is\n      another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction should be\n      pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the\n      reverse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “To proceed: <i>ceteris paribus</i>, he who pleases is of more importance\n      to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and\n      pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means\n      of obtaining.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves\n      so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to\n      instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for\n      their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment;\n      contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are\n      professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in\n      need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of\n      the devil in ‘Melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably, through three octavo\n      volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any\n      common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.\n    </p>\n<pre>“Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it\nbecomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest.\nYet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in\ncontemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and\nlearning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their\nauthority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my\nheart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect\nwith the passions-or age with poetry.\n\n     “‘Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;\n     He who would search for pearls must dive below,’\n</pre>\n<p>\n      are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,\n      men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies\n      in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable palaces\n      where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding—the\n      goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon\n      philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith—that moral\n      mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of\n      a man.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We see an instance of Coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘Biographia\n      Literaria’—professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact,\n      a treatise <i>de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. </i>He goes wrong by\n      reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in\n      the contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely\n      sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who\n      surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\n      useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the\n      feelings of a poet I believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in\n      his writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his <i>El Dorado)-but\n      they </i>have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at\n      best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few\n      straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\n      of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light\n      which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is\n      too correct. This may not be understood-but the old Goths of Germany would\n      have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their\n      State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they might\n      not be deficient in formality—drunk lest they should be destitute of\n      vigor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration\n      of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such\n      assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)—‘Of\n      genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done,\n      and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it follows that in doing\n      what is unworthy to be done, or what <i>has </i>been done before, no\n      genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act,\n      pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pickpocket,\n      in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William\n      Wordsworth, the poet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian’s\n      or Macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to\n      prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the\n      controversy. <i>Tantaene animis? </i>Can great minds descend to such\n      absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor\n      of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his\n      abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. It is the\n      beginning of the epic poem ‘Temora.’ ‘The blue waves of Ullin roll in\n      light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads\n      in the breeze.’ And this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is\n      alive and panting with immortality-this, William Wordsworth, the author of\n      ‘Peter Bell,’ has <i>selected </i>for his contempt. We shall see what\n      better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:\n    </p>\n<pre>     “‘And now she’s at the pony’s tail,\n     And now she’s at the pony’s head,\n     On that side now, and now on this;\n     And, almost stifled with her bliss,\n\n     A few sad tears does Betty shed....\n     She pats the pony, where or when\n     She knows not.... happy Betty Foy!\n     Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!’\n</pre>\n<p>\n      Secondly:\n    </p>\n<pre>     “‘The dew was falling fast, the-stars began to blink;\n     I heard a voice: it said-“Drink, pretty creature, drink!”\n      And, looking o’er the hedge, be-fore me I espied\n     A snow-white mountain lamb, with a-maiden at its side.\n     No other sheep was near,—the lamb was all alone,\n     And by a slender cord was-tether’d to a stone.’\n</pre>\n<p>\n      “Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we\n      will, Mr. W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a\n      sheep from the bottom of my heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But there are occasions, dear B-, there are occasions when even\n      Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,\n      and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an\n      extract from his preface:—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers, if\n      they persist in reading this book to a conclusion <i>(impossible!) will,\n      </i>no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!)\n      they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced to\n      inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to\n      assume that title.’ Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the\n      bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a\n      tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Of Coleridge, I can not speak but with reverence. His towering intellect!\n      his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself, <i>‘Tai trouvé\n      souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce\n      qu’elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu’elles nient,’ and </i>to employ\n      his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he\n      has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to think that such a\n      mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the Nyctanthes, waste its\n      perfume upon the night alone. In reading that man’s poetry, I tremble like\n      one who stands upon a volcano, conscious from the very darkness bursting\n      from the crater, of the fire and the light that are weltering below.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What is poetry?—Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many\n      appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! ‘Give me,’ I demanded of a\n      scholar some time ago, ‘give me a definition of poetry.’ <i>‘Trèsvolontiers;’\n      </i>and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and\n      overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakespeare! I\n      imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of\n      that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B-, think of poetry, and\n      then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and\n      fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his\n      huge bulk, the Elephant! and then-and then think of the ‘Tempest’—the\n      ‘Midsummer-Night’s Dream’—Prospero Oberon—and Titania!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its\n      <i>immediate </i>object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for\n      its object, an <i>indefinite </i>instead of a <i>definite </i>pleasure,\n      being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting\n      perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations, to\n      which end music is an <i>essential, since </i>the comprehension of sweet\n      sound is our most indefinite conception.

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.67\"></a>NOTES</h2>\n<p>\n      30. On the “Poems written in Youth” little comment is needed. This section\n      includes the pieces printed for first volume of 1827 (which was\n      subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published\n      volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised\n      versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “Al Aaraaf”\n       first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829, and\n      is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however,\n      this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following\n      twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in—all subsequent\n      collections:\n    </p>\n<pre>     AL AARAAF\n\n     Mysterious star!\n     Thou wert my dream\n     All a long summer night—\n     Be now my theme!\n     By this clear stream,\n     Of thee will I write;\n     Meantime from afar\n     Bathe me in light I\n\n     Thy world has not the dross of ours,\n     Yet all the beauty-all the flowers\n     That list our love or deck our bowers\n     In dreamy gardens, where do lie\n     Dreamy maidens all the day;\n     While the silver winds of Circassy\n     On violet couches faint away.\n     Little—oh “little dwells in thee”\n      Like unto what on earth we see:\n     Beauty’s eye is here the bluest\n     In the falsest and untruest—On the sweetest\n     air doth float\n     The most sad and solemn note—\n\n     If with thee be broken hearts,\n     Joy so peacefully departs,\n     That its echo still doth dwell,\n     Like the murmur in the shell.\n     Thou! thy truest type of grief\n     Is the gently falling leaf!\n     Thy framing is so holy\n     Sorrow is not melancholy.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      31. The earliest version of “Tamerlane” was included in the suppressed\n      volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now\n      published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and\n      improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the\n      lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at\n      least.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      32. “To Helen” first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also “The Valley\n      of Unrest” (as “The Valley Nis”), “Israfel,” and one or two others of the\n      youthful pieces. The poem styled “Romance,” constituted the Preface of the\n      1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:\n    </p>\n<pre>     Succeeding years, too wild for song,\n     Then rolled like tropic storms along,\n     Where, through the garish lights that fly\n     Dying along the troubled sky,\n     Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,\n     The blackness of the general Heaven,\n     That very blackness yet doth Ring\n     Light on the lightning’s silver wing.\n\n     For being an idle boy lang syne;\n     Who read Anacreon and drank wine,\n     I early found Anacreon rhymes\n     Were almost passionate sometimes—\n     And by strange alchemy of brain\n     His pleasures always turned to pain—\n     His naiveté to wild desire—\n     His wit to love-his wine to fire—\n     And so, being young and dipt in folly,\n     I fell in love with melancholy,\n\n     And used to throw my earthly rest\n     And quiet all away in jest—\n     I could not love except where Death\n     Was mingling his with Beauty’s breath—\n     Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,\n     Were stalking between her and me.\n</pre>\n<hr>\n<pre>     But now my soul hath too much room—\n     Gone are the glory and the gloom—\n     The black hath mellow’d into gray,\n     And all the fires are fading away.\n\n     My draught of passion hath been deep—\n     I revell’d, and I now would sleep\n     And after drunkenness of soul\n     Succeeds the glories of the bowl\n     An idle longing night and day\n     To dream my very life away.\n\n     But dreams—of those who dream as I,\n     Aspiringly, are damned, and die:\n     Yet should I swear I mean alone,\n     By notes so very shrilly blown,\n     To break upon Time’s monotone,\n     While yet my vapid joy and grief\n     Are tintless of the yellow leaf—\n     Why not an imp the graybeard hath,\n     Will shake his shadow in my path—\n     And e’en the graybeard will o’erlook\n     Connivingly my dreaming-book.\n</pre>\n",

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap5.73\"></a>NOTES</h2>\n<p>\n      Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe, and\n      not included among his known writings, the lines entitled “Alone” have the\n      chief claim to our notice. <i>Fac-simile </i>copies of this piece had been\n      in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication\n      in “Scribner’s Magazine” for September, 1875; but as proofs of the\n      authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from\n      publishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been adduced,\n      and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us.\n      “Alone” is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore\n      lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the facsimile given in\n      “Scribner’s” is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the caligraphy be\n      Poe’s, it is different in all essential respects from all the many\n      specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the\n      heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the\n      poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not\n      by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made\n      public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, “are not\n      unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      While Edgar Poe was editor of the “Broadway Journal,” some lines “To\n      Isadore” appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no\n      signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy\n      questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were\n      by “A. Ide, junior.” Two previous poems had appeared in the “Broadway\n      journal” over the signature of “A. M. Ide,” and whoever wrote them was\n      also the author of the lines “To Isadore.” In order, doubtless, to give a\n      show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his\n      journal over <i>noms de plume, </i>and as no other writings whatever can\n      be traced to any person bearing the name of “A. M. Ide,” it is not\n      impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the\n      author of “The Raven.” Having been published without his usual elaborate\n      revision, Poe may have wished to <i>hide </i>his hasty work under an\n      assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so\n      the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by\n      the author of “The Raven.”\n     </p>\n"

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap01\"></a>EDGAR ALLAN POE<br>\nAN APPRECIATION</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n   Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>\n   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>\n   Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>\n         Of “never—never more!”\n </p>\n<p>\n      This stanza from “The Raven” was recommended by James Russell Lowell as an\n      inscription upon the Baltimore monument which marks the resting place of\n      Edgar Allan Poe, the most interesting and original figure in American\n      letters. And, to signify that peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius\n      which inthralls every reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional verse,\n      from the “Haunted Palace”:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n   And all with pearl and ruby glowing<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the fair palace door,<br>\n   Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sparkling ever more,<br>\n   A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but to sing,<br>\n   In voices of surpassing beauty,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wit and wisdom of their king.\n</p>\n<p>\n      Born in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful\n      circumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary career of\n      scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere subsistence, his memory\n      malignantly misrepresented by his earliest biographer, Griswold, how\n      completely has truth at last routed falsehood and how magnificently has\n      Poe come into his own. For “The Raven,” first published in 1845, and,\n      within a few months, read, recited and parodied wherever the English\n      language was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less than a year\n      later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching appeal to the\n      admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his dying wife and\n      her devoted mother, then living under very straitened circumstances in a\n      little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men of\n      genius, and one of the most industrious of the literary profession of our\n      country, whose temporary suspension of labor, from bodily illness, drops\n      him immediately to a level with the common objects of public charity.\n      There is no intermediate stopping-place, no respectful shelter, where,\n      with the delicacy due to genius and culture, he might secure aid, till,\n      with returning health, he would resume his labors, and his unmortified\n      sense of independence.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the master who had\n      given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of witchery and mystery as “The\n      Fall of the House of Usher” and “Ligeia”; such fascinating hoaxes as “The\n      Unparalleled Adventure of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a Bottle,” “A\n      Descent Into a Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales of conscience\n      as “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale Heart,” wherein\n      the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful fidelity; such\n      tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay” and “The Domain of\n      Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in ratiocination as the “Gold-bug,” “The\n      Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Purloined Letter” and “The Mystery of\n      Marie Roget,” the latter, a recital of fact, demonstrating the author’s\n      wonderful capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human\n      mind; such tales of illusion and banter as “The Premature Burial” and “The\n      System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether”; such bits of extravaganza as\n      “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The Angel of the Odd”; such tales of\n      adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym”; such papers of keen\n      criticism and review as won for Poe the enthusiastic admiration of Charles\n      Dickens, although they made him many enemies among the over-puffed minor\n      American writers so mercilessly exposed by him; such poems of beauty and\n      melody as “The Bells,” “The Haunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the\n      Sea” and “The Raven.” What delight for the jaded senses of the reader is\n      this enchanted domain of wonder-pieces! What an atmosphere of beauty,\n      music, color! What resources of imagination, construction, analysis and\n      absolute art! One might almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who,\n      confessing to a half faith in the old superstition of the significance of\n      anagrams, found, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name, the words\n      “a God-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted Palace,” echoing\n      to the footfalls of angels and demons.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to record,\n      the wonders of his inner life.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In these twentieth century days—of lavish recognition—artistic,\n      popular and material—of genius, what rewards might not a Poe claim!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Edgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American revolutionary\n      patriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs. Hopkins, an English\n      actress, and, the match meeting with parental disapproval, had himself\n      taken to the stage as a profession. Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty and\n      talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence. When Edgar, at\n      the age of two years, was orphaned, the family was in the utmost\n      destitution. Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world\n      homeless and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine\n      were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted by John\n      Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and sister, the\n      remaining children, were cared for by others.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money could\n      provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers. In Mrs. Allan\n      he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow. Mr. Allan took\n      much pride in the captivating, precocious lad. At the age of five the boy\n      recited, with fine effect, passages of English poetry to the visitors at\n      the Allan house.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor House school,\n      at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the Rev. Dr. Bransby, head\n      of the school, whom Poe so quaintly portrayed in “William Wilson.”\n       Returning to Richmond in 1820 Edgar was sent to the school of Professor\n      Joseph H. Clarke. He proved an apt pupil. Years afterward Professor Clarke\n      thus wrote:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote genuine\n      poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was ambitious to excel.\n      He was remarkable for self-respect, without haughtiness. He had a\n      sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend. His nature\n      was entirely free from selfishness.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at\n      Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session. Official\n      records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary, he gained a\n      creditable record as a student, although it is admitted that he contracted\n      debts and had “an ungovernable passion for card-playing.” These debts may\n      have led to his quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually compelled him to\n      make his own way in the world.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced Calvin\n      Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small volume of his\n      verses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.” In 1829 we find Poe in\n      Baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses, which was soon\n      published. Its title was “Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither\n      of these ventures seems to have attracted much attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Soon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe, through the\n      aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United States Military Academy\n      at West Point. Any glamour which may have attached to cadet life in Poe’s\n      eyes was speedily lost, for discipline at West Point was never so severe\n      nor were the accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was more and more\n      toward literature. Life at the academy daily became increasingly\n      distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and to\n      disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal from the\n      United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7, 1831, Poe found\n      himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had thrown the lad on his own\n      resources. His literary career was to begin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Poe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the successful\n      competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore periodical for the\n      best prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle” was the winning tale. Poe had\n      submitted six stories in a volume. “Our only difficulty,” says Mr.\n      Latrobe, one of the judges, “was in selecting from the rich contents of\n      the volume.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected with\n      various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia and New York.\n      He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough. N. P. Willis, who for\n      some time employed Poe as critic and sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,”\n       wrote thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness to let it\n      alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by common report to\n      expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and occasionally a scene\n      of violence and difficulty. Time went on, however, and he was invariably\n      punctual and industrious. We saw but one presentiment of the man—a quiet,\n      patient, industrious and most gentlemanly person.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in all\n      mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single glass of\n      wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became uppermost, and,\n      though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible, his will was\n      palpably insane. In this reversed character, we repeat, it was never our\n      chance to meet him.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in\n      Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was but\n      twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular contributor\n      to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not until a year later that\n      the bride and her widowed mother followed him thither.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful features of\n      his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her\n      beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for its victim, and the\n      constant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the\n      comfort and happiness their slender means permitted. Virginia died January\n      30, 1847, when but twenty-five years of age. A friend of the family\n      pictures the death-bed scene—mother and husband trying to impart\n      warmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was\n      suffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last year of\n      his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his child-wife:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n<i>I</i> was a child and <i>she</i> was a child,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a kingdom by the sea;<br>\n     But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I and my Annabel Lee;<br>\n     With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coveted her and me.<br>\n     And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the sea.<br>\n     A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>\n     So that her high-born kinsmen came<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore her away from me,<br>\n     To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n      Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the\n      “Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s Magazine” and\n      the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the “Evening Mirror,” the\n      “Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s Book” in New York. Everywhere\n      Poe’s life was one of unremitting toil. No tales and poems were ever\n      produced at a greater cost of brain and spirit.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to which he\n      contributed the first drafts of a number of his best-known tales, was $10\n      a week! Two years later his salary was but $600 a year. Even in 1844, when\n      his literary reputation was established securely, he wrote to a friend\n      expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute\n      had agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe never lost\n      faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent talents win\n      admirers. His genius has had no better description than in this stanza\n      from William Winter’s poem, read at the dedication exercises of the\n      Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885, in New York:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     He was the voice of beauty and of woe,<br>\n     Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;<br>\n     Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,<br>\n     Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,<br>\n     Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,<br>\n     Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,<br>\n     Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel whispers, fluttering from on high,<br>\n     And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.\n</p>\n<p>\n      In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s\n      death he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s\n      malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe as man\n      and as writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill, Eugene Didier,\n      Sarah Helen Whitman and others these scandals have been dispelled and Poe\n      is seen as he actually was—not as a man without failings, it is\n      true, but as the finest and most original genius in American letters. As\n      the years go on his fame increases. His works have been translated into\n      many foreign languages. His is a household name in France and\n      England—in fact, the latter nation has often uttered the reproach\n      that Poe’s own country has been slow to appreciate him. But that\n      reproach, if it ever was warranted, certainly is untrue.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\nW. H. R.\n</p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>EDGAR ALLAN POE</h2>\n<p class=\"center\">\nBy James Russell Lowell\n</p>\n<p>\n      The situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no centre, or,\n      if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes. It is divided into\n      many systems, each revolving round its several suns, and often presenting\n      to the rest only the faint glimmer of a milk-and-water way. Our capital\n      city, unlike London or Paris, is not a great central heart from which life\n      and vigor radiate to the extremities, but resembles more an isolated\n      umbilicus stuck down as near as may be to the centre of the land, and\n      seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any\n      present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its literature\n      almost more distinct than those of the different dialects of Germany; and\n      the Young Queen of the West has also one of her own, of which some\n      articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the Atlantic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of\n      contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give praise where it\n      is needed than where it is deserved, and friendship so often seduces the\n      iron stylus of justice into a vague flourish, that she writes what seems\n      rather like an epitaph than a criticism. Yet if praise be given as an\n      alms, we could not drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The\n      critic’s ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or\n      of sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we might\n      readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding place of truth,\n      did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find mixed with it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of\n      imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude and\n      peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The offspring of a\n      romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early age, he was adopted by\n      Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose barren marriage-bed seemed the\n      warranty of a large estate to the young poet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having received a classical education in England, he returned home and\n      entered the University of Virginia, where, after an extravagant course,\n      followed by reformation at the last extremity, he was graduated with the\n      highest honors of his class. Then came a boyish attempt to join the\n      fortunes of the insurgent Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where he\n      got into difficulties through want of a passport, from which he was\n      rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the military\n      academy at West Point, from which he obtained a dismissal on hearing of\n      the birth of a son to his adopted father, by a second marriage, an event\n      which cut off his expectations as an heir. The death of Mr. Allan, in\n      whose will his name was not mentioned, soon after relieved him of all\n      doubt in this regard, and he committed himself at once to authorship for a\n      support. Previously to this, however, he had published (in 1827) a small\n      volume of poems, which soon ran through three editions, and excited high\n      expectations of its author’s future distinction in the minds of many\n      competent judges.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest lispings there\n      are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first poems, though brimful\n      of vigor and youth and picturesqueness, give but a very faint promise of\n      the directness, condensation and overflowing moral of his maturer works.\n      Perhaps, however, Shakespeare is hardly a case in point, his “Venus and\n      Adonis” having been published, we believe, in his twenty-sixth year.\n      Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for nature, and a\n      delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint of the author of\n      a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have all the sing-song,\n      wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity and eloquent irreligion of\n      his later productions. Collins’ callow namby-pamby died and gave no sign\n      of the vigorous and original genius which he afterward displayed. We have\n      never thought that the world lost more in the “marvellous boy,”\n       Chatterton, than a very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated\n      dulness. Where he becomes original (as it is called), the interest of\n      ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke White’s promises were\n      indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey, but surely with no\n      authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a traditional piety, which\n      to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less objectionable in the retired\n      closet of a diary, and in the sober raiment of prose. They do not clutch\n      hold of the memory with the drowning pertinacity of Watts; neither have\n      they the interest of his occasional simple, lucky beauty. Burns having\n      fortunately been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating\n      society of the “Best models,” wrote well and naturally from the first. Had\n      he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste, we should have\n      had a series of poems from which, as from his letters, we could sift here\n      and there a kernel from the mass of chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts\n      give no promise whatever of that poetical genius which produced at once\n      the wildest, tenderest, most original and most purely imaginative poems of\n      modern times. Byron’s “Hours of Idleness” would never find a reader except\n      from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity. In Wordsworth’s first\n      preludings there is but a dim foreboding of the creator of an era. From\n      Southey’s early poems, a safer augury might have been drawn. They show the\n      patient investigator, the close student of history, and the unwearied\n      explorer of the beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a\n      man who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer and\n      more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The earliest specimens\n      of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give tokens of that ethereal\n      sublimation in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions of words,\n      but leaves its body, the verse, to be entombed, without hope of\n      resurrection, in a mass of them. Cowley is generally instanced as a wonder\n      of precocity. But his early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming\n      and for the metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of\n      words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical organization,\n      and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only remarkable when it displays\n      an effort of <i>reason,</i> and the rudest verses in which we can trace\n      some conception of the ends of poetry, are worth all the miracles of\n      smooth juvenile versification. A school-boy, one would say, might acquire\n      the regular see-saw of Pope merely by an association with the motion of\n      the play-ground tilt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the verse to\n      the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling that all the life\n      and grace of the one must depend on and be modulated by the will of the\n      other. We call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have ever\n      read. We know of none that can compare with them for maturity of purpose,\n      and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre. Such pieces\n      are only valuable when they display what we can only express by the\n      contradictory phrase of <i>innate experience.</i> We copy one of the\n      shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen. There is a\n      little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and symmetry of the\n      outline are such as few poets ever attain. There is a smack of ambrosia\n      about it.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n     TO HELEN\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nHelen, thy beauty is to me<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those Nicean barks of yore,<br>\nThat gently, o’er a perfumed sea,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weary, way-worn wanderer bore<br>\nTo his own native shore.<br>\n<br>\nOn desperate seas long wont to roam,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,<br>\nThy Naiad airs have brought me home<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the glory that was Greece<br>\nAnd the grandeur that was Rome.<br>\n<br>\nLo! in yon brilliant window-niche<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How statue-like I see thee stand!<br>\nThe agate lamp within thy hand,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Psyche, from the regions which<br>\nAre Holy Land!\n</p>\n<p>\n      It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is no\n      “withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got into its\n      teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which Byron had brought into\n      vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a pleasant dash of the Greek Helicon\n      in it. The melody of the whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of that kind\n      which can be demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers. It\n      is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone <i>can</i> estimate. It\n      seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its perfection. In a poem\n      named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended to personify the music of\n      nature, our boy-poet gives us the following exquisite picture:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ligeia! Ligeia!<br>\nMy beautiful one,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose harshest idea<br>\nWill to melody run,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, is it thy will,<br>\nOn the breezes to toss,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, capriciously still,<br>\nLike the lone albatross,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incumbent on night,<br>\nAs she on the air,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep watch with delight<br>\nOn the harmony there?\n</p>\n<p>\n      John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too long\n      capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and similar\n      passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call <i>genius</i>.\n      No man could ever tell us precisely what it is, and yet there is none who\n      is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power. Let talent writhe\n      and contort itself as it may, it has no such magnetism. Larger of bone and\n      sinew it may be, but the wings are wanting. Talent sticks fast to earth,\n      and its most perfect works have still one foot of clay. Genius claims\n      kindred with the very workings of Nature herself, so that a sunset shall\n      seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare be read in the very\n      presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but seem nobler for the\n      sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make friends for itself, but only\n      genius can give to its creations the divine power of winning love and\n      veneration. Enthusiasm cannot cling to what itself is unenthusiastic, nor\n      will he ever have disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to\n      be a disciple. Great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they are\n      possessed and carried away by their demon, while talent keeps him, as\n      Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the pommel of his sword. To the eye\n      of genius, the veil of the spiritual world is ever rent asunder that it\n      may perceive the ministers of good and evil who throng continually around\n      it. No man of mere talent ever flung his inkstand at the devil.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that he has\n      produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he possesses it at all\n      is to say that he needs only zeal, industry, and a reverence for the trust\n      reposed in him, to achieve the proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels.\n      If we may believe the Longinuses and Aristotles of our newspapers, we\n      have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among\n      them at all desirable, whether for its hardness of attainment or its\n      seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is, according to these\n      gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion of the country, a\n      circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable residence for individuals\n      of a poetical temperament, if love of solitude be, as immemorial tradition\n      asserts, a necessary part of their idiosyncrasy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of vigorous\n      yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of imagination. The first\n      of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words, as a knowledge of\n      anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone. This enables him to\n      conceive truly, to maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a\n      correct outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both of\n      these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose works,\n      the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the first in his later\n      ones. In judging of the merit of an author, and assigning him his niche\n      among our household gods, we have a right to regard him from our own point\n      of view, and to measure him by our own standard. But, in estimating the\n      amount of power displayed in his works, we must be governed by his own\n      design, and placing them by the side of his own ideal, find how much is\n      wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions of the objects of art. He\n      esteems that object to be the creation of Beauty, and perhaps it is only\n      in the definition of that word that we disagree with him. But in what we\n      shall say of his writings, we shall take his own standard as our guide.\n      The temple of the god of song is equally accessible from every side, and\n      there is room enough in it for all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that dim\n      region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable into\n      the weird confines of superstition and unreality. He combines in a very\n      remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united; a power of\n      influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery,\n      and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button\n      unnoticed. Both are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating\n      quality of his mind, to which we have before alluded, analysis. It is this\n      which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once reaches forward to the\n      effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring about certain emotions in\n      the reader, he makes all subordinate parts tend strictly to the common\n      centre. Even his mystery is mathematical to his own mind. To him X is a\n      known quantity all along. In any picture that he paints he understands the\n      chemical properties of all his colors. However vague some of his figures\n      may seem, however formless the shadows, to him the outline is as clear and\n      distinct as that of a geometrical diagram. For this reason Mr. Poe has no\n      sympathy with Mysticism. The Mystic dwells in the mystery, is enveloped\n      with it; it colors all his thoughts; it affects his optic nerve\n      especially, and the commonest things get a rainbow edging from it. Mr.\n      Poe, on the other hand, is a spectator <i>ab extra</i>. He analyzes, he\n      dissects, he watches\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“with an eye serene,<br>\n     The very pulse of the machine,”\n </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      for such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and piston-rods,\n      all working to produce a certain end.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by giving\n      him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a wonderful reality\n      into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he paints with great power. He\n      loves to dissect one of these cancers of the mind, and to trace all the\n      subtle ramifications of its roots. In raising images of horror, also, he\n      has strange success, conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some\n      terrible <i>doubt</i> which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to\n      imagination the task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she is\n      competent.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     “For much imaginary work was there;<br>\n     Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,<br>\n     That for Achilles’ image stood his spear<br>\n     Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind<br>\n     Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”\n </p>\n<p>\n      Besides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also that of\n      form.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It would be\n      hard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers. As an\n      example of his style we would refer to one of his tales, “The House of\n      Usher,” in the first volume of his “Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.”\n       It has a singular charm for us, and we think that no one could read it\n      without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty. Had its\n      author written nothing else, it would alone have been enough to stamp him\n      as a man of genius, and the master of a classic style. In this tale\n      occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and the\n      unreal as sources of effect. They have not used dread and horror alone,\n      but only in combination with other qualities, as means of subjugating the\n      fancies of their readers. The loftiest muse has ever a household and\n      fireside charm about her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in the skill with\n      which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror. In\n      this his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of art,\n      not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest or purest, but we\n      must concede to him the highest merit of construction.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his analysis\n      of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the faculty of\n      perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His criticisms are, however,\n      distinguished for scientific precision and coherence of logic. They have\n      the exactness, and at the same time, the coldness of mathematical\n      demonstrations. Yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with the\n      vague generalisms and sharp personalities of the day. If deficient in\n      warmth, they are also without the heat of partisanship. They are\n      especially valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally\n      overlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the critic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has attained an\n      individual eminence in our literature which he will keep. He has given\n      proof of power and originality.

Willis\n</p>\n<p>\n      The ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one body,\n      equally powerful and having the complete mastery by turns-of one man, that\n      is to say, inhabited by both a devil and an angel seems to have been\n      realized, if all we hear is true, in the character of the extraordinary\n      man whose name we have written above. Our own impression of the nature of\n      Edgar A. Poe, differs in some important degree, however, from that which\n      has been generally conveyed in the notices of his death. Let us, before\n      telling what we personally know of him, copy a graphic and highly finished\n      portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W. Griswold, which appeared in a\n      recent number of the “Tribune”:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October 7th.\n      This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it. The\n      poet was known, personally or by reputation, in all this country; he had\n      readers in England and in several of the states of Continental Europe; but\n      he had few or no friends; and the regrets for his death will be suggested\n      principally by the consideration that in him literary art has lost one of\n      its most brilliant but erratic stars.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its eloquence. His\n      voice was modulated with astonishing skill, and his large and variably\n      expressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who\n      listened, while his own face glowed, or was changeless in pallor, as his\n      imagination quickened his blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His\n      imagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision\n      of genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply\n      defined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected the\n      forms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of accretion, built\n      up his ocular demonstrations in forms of gloomiest and ghastliest\n      grandeur, or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty, so minutely\n      and distinctly, yet so rapidly, that the attention which was yielded to\n      him was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations, till he\n      himself dissolved the spell, and brought his hearers back to common and\n      base existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest passion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms in heaven or\n      hell peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his brain. He\n      walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in\n      indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer (never for\n      himself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned,\n      but) for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his idolatry;\n      or with his glances introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with a\n      face shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all night,\n      with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and rains, would speak\n      as if the spirits that at such times only could be evoked by him from the\n      Aidenn, close by whose portals his disturbed soul sought to forget the\n      ills to which his constitution subjected him—close by the Aidenn\n      where were those he loved—the Aidenn which he might never see, but in\n      fitful glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more\n      happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will and\n      engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some controlling\n      sorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was probably much more nearly\n      than has been supposed, even by those who were very intimate with him, a\n      reflection and an echo of his own history. <i>He</i> was that bird’s\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ‘Never—never more.’\n</p>\n<p>\n      “Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his\n      works, whatever their design, traces of his personal character: elements\n      of his immortal being, in which the individual survives the person. While\n      we read the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of Usher,’ or of\n      ‘Mesmeric Revelations,’ we see in the solemn and stately\n      gloom which invests one, and in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both,\n      indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was most remarkable and\n      peculiar in the author’s intellectual nature. But we see here only\n      the better phases of his nature, only the symbols of his juster action,\n      for his harsh experience had deprived him of all faith in man or woman.\n      He had made up his mind upon the numberless complexities of the social\n      world, and the whole system with him was an imposture. This conviction\n      gave a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character. Still,\n      though he regarded society as composed altogether of villains, the\n      sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope\n      with villany, while it continually caused him by overshots to fail of the\n      success of honesty. He was in many respects like Francis Vivian in\n      Bulwer’s novel of ‘The Caxtons.’ Passion, in him,\n      comprehended many of the worst emotions which militate against human\n      happiness. You could not contradict him, but you raised quick choler; you\n      could not speak of wealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing envy. The\n      astonishing natural advantages of this poor boy—his beauty, his\n      readiness, the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery\n      atmosphere—had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an\n      arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into prejudices\n      against him. Irascible, envious—bad enough, but not the worst, for\n      these salient angles were all varnished over with a cold, repellant\n      cynicism, his passions vented themselves in sneers. There seemed to him\n      no moral susceptibility; and, what was more remarkable in a proud nature,\n      little or nothing of the true point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess,\n      that, desire to rise which is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for\n      the esteem or the love of his species; only the hard wish to\n      succeed—not shine, not serve—succeed, that he might have the\n      right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes upon\n      his literature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in his earlier\n      writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or three\n      years—including much of his best poetry—was in some sense\n      biographical; in draperies of his imagination, those who had taken the\n      trouble to trace his steps, could perceive, but slightly concealed, the\n      figure of himself.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Apropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written sketch, let\n      us truthfully say:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Some four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this city,\n      Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic and sub-editor.\n      This was our first personal acquaintance with him. He resided with his\n      wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town, but was at his desk\n      in the office, from nine in the morning till the evening paper went to\n      press. With the highest admiration for his genius, and a willingness to\n      let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by common\n      report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and\n      occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on, however,\n      and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With his pale, beautiful,\n      and intellectual face, as a reminder of what genius was in him, it was\n      impossible, of course, not to treat him always with deferential courtesy,\n      and, to our occasional request that he would not probe too deep in a\n      criticism, or that he would erase a passage colored too highly with his\n      resentments against society and mankind, he readily and courteously\n      assented—far more yielding than most men, we thought, on points so\n      excusably sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in another\n      periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment with us, and,\n      through all this considerable period, we had seen but one presentment of\n      the man—a quiet, patient, industrious, and most gentlemanly person,\n      commanding the utmost respect and good feeling by his unvarying\n      deportment and ability.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Residing as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours of\n      leisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place of\n      business, and we met him often in the street—invariably the same\n      sad mannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had always known\n      him. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his death, that we knew of\n      any other development of manner or character. We heard, from one who knew\n      him well (what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable\n      irregularities), that, with a single glass of wine, his whole nature was\n      reversed, the demon became uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs\n      of intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane. Possessing\n      his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such times, and seeking\n      his acquaintances with his wonted look and memory, he easily seemed\n      personating only another phase of his natural character, and was accused,\n      accordingly, of insulting arrogance and bad-heartedness. In this reversed\n      character, we repeat, it was never our chance to see him. We know it from\n      hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity of\n      physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the ground of a\n      temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe was\n      generally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this reversed phase\n      of his character. Under that degree of intoxication which only acted upon\n      him by demonizing his sense of truth and right, he doubtless said and did\n      much that was wholly irreconcilable with his better nature; but, when\n      himself, and as we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected humility, as\n      to his own deservings, were a constant charm to his character. His\n      letters, of which the constant application for autographs has taken from\n      us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion, exhibited this quality\n      very strongly. In one of the carelessly written notes of which we chance\n      still to retain possession, for instance, he speaks of “The\n      Raven”—that extraordinary poem which electrified the world of\n      imaginative readers, and has become the type of a school of poetry of its\n      own—and, in evident earnest, attributes its success to the few\n      words of commendation with which we had prefaced it in this\n      paper. It will throw light on his sane character to give a literal copy\n      of the note:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n“F<small>ORDHAM</small>, <i>April</i> 20, 1849\n</p>\n<p>\n      “M<small>Y</small> D<small>EAR</small>\n      W<small>ILLIS</small>—The poem which I inclose, and which I am so\n      vain as to hope you will like, in some respects, has been just published\n      in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to write, now and then.\n      It pays well as times go-but unquestionably it ought to pay ten prices;\n      for whatever I send it I feel I am consigning to the tomb of the\n      Capulets.

With this end in view, I must get a list\n      of at least five hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two hundred I\n      have already. I propose, however, to go South and West, among my personal\n      and literary friends—old college and West Point acquaintances—and\n      see what I can do. In order to get the means of taking the first step, I\n      propose to lecture at the Society Library, on Thursday, the 3d of\n      February, and, that there may be no cause of <i>squabbling</i>, my subject\n      shall <i>not be literary</i> at all.

Such he assuredly was when sane. Such\n      only he has invariably seemed to us, in all we have happened personally to\n      know of him, through a friendship of five or six years. And so much easier\n      is it to believe what we have seen and known, than what we hear of only,\n      that we remember him but with admiration and respect; these descriptions\n      of him, when morally insane, seeming to us like portraits, painted in\n      sickness, of a man we have only known in health.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But there is another, more touching, and far more forcible evidence that\n      there was <i>goodness</i> in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it we are obliged to\n      venture upon the lifting of the veil which sacredly covers grief and\n      refinement in poverty; but we think it may be excused, if so we can\n      brighten the memory of the poet, even were there not a more needed and\n      immediate service which it may render to the nearest link broken by his\n      death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a call which\n      we received from a lady who introduced herself to us as the mother of his\n      wife. She was in search of employment for him, and she excused her errand\n      by mentioning that he was ill, that her daughter was a confirmed invalid,\n      and that their circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon\n      herself. The countenance of this lady, made beautiful and saintly with an\n      evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and sorrowful\n      tenderness, her gentle and mournful voice urging its plea, her\n      long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined manners, and her\n      appealing and yet appreciative mention of the claims and abilities of her\n      son, disclosed at once the presence of one of those angels upon earth that\n      women in adversity can be. It was a hard fate that she was watching over.\n      Mr. Poe wrote with fastidious difficulty, and in a style too much above\n      the popular level to be well paid. He was always in pecuniary difficulty,\n      and, with his sick wife, frequently in want of the merest necessaries of\n      life. Winter after winter, for years, the most touching sight to us, in\n      this whole city, has been that tireless minister to genius, thinly and\n      insufficiently clad, going from office to office with a poem, or an\n      article on some literary subject, to sell, sometimes simply pleading in a\n      broken voice that he was ill, and begging for him, mentioning nothing but\n      that “he was ill,” whatever might be the reason for his writing nothing,\n      and never, amid all her tears and recitals of distress, suffering one\n      syllable to escape her lips that could convey a doubt of him, or a\n      complaint, or a lessening of pride in his genius and good intentions. Her\n      daughter died a year and a half since, but she did not desert him. She\n      continued his ministering angel—living with him, caring for him,\n      guarding him against exposure, and when he was carried away by temptation,\n      amid grief and the loneliness of feelings unreplied to, and awoke from his\n      self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering, <i>begging</i>\n      for him still. If woman’s devotion, born with a first love, and fed with\n      human passion, hallow its object, as it is allowed to do, what does not a\n      devotion like this—pure, disinterested and holy as the watch of an\n      invisible spirit—say for him who inspired it?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We have a letter before us, written by this lady, Mrs. Clemm, on the\n      morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her untiring\n      care. It is merely a request that we would call upon her, but we will copy\n      a few of its words—sacred as its privacy is—to warrant the\n      truth of the picture we have drawn above, and add force to the appeal we\n      wish to make for her:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have this morning heard of the death of my darling Eddie.... Can you\n      give me any circumstances or particulars?... Oh! do not desert your poor\n      friend in his bitter affliction!... Ask Mr. —— to come, as I\n      must deliver a message to him from my poor Eddie.... I need not ask you to\n      notice his death and to speak well of him. I know you will. But say what\n      an affectionate son he was to me, his poor desolate mother...”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      To hedge round a grave with respect, what choice is there, between the\n      relinquished wealth and honors of the world, and the story of such a\n      woman’s unrewarded devotion! Risking what we do, in delicacy, by making it\n      public, we feel—other reasons aside—that it betters the world\n      to make known that there are such ministrations to its erring and gifted.\n      What we have said will speak to some hearts. There are those who will be\n      glad to know how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their\n      far-away recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they may\n      send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction, some token\n      of their sympathy. She is destitute and alone. If any, far or near, will\n      send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder of her life,\n      we will joyfully place it in her hands.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap04\"></a>THE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAAL (*1)</h2>\n<p>\n      By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state of\n      philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a\n      nature so completely unexpected—so entirely novel—so utterly\n      at variance with preconceived opinions—as to leave no doubt on my\n      mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a\n      ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It appears that on the—— day of—— (I am not\n      positive about the date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not\n      specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange\n      in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm—unusually\n      so for the season—there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the\n      multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with\n      friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses\n      of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the\n      firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation\n      became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues\n      succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned\n      toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the\n      corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to\n      nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously,\n      through all the environs of Rotterdam.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind\n      the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already\n      mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a\n      queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so\n      whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and\n      never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood\n      open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and\n      devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one\n      could imagine; no one—not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von\n      Underduk—had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so,\n      as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his\n      pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye\n      towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted\n      significantly—then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally—puffed\n      again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city,\n      came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In a\n      very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It\n      appeared to be—yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but\n      surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who,\n      let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty\n      newspapers? No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of\n      the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical\n      thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the\n      precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a\n      similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the\n      burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even\n      still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge\n      foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no\n      means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large\n      tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the\n      cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept\n      up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.\n      Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there\n      hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a brim\n      superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a\n      silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of\n      Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed\n      the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the\n      vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful\n      surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself.\n      Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with three\n      companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years\n      before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of\n      this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence\n      concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones which were thought to\n      be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately\n      discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some\n      people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been\n      committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Pfaall and\n      his associates. But to return.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a\n      hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently\n      distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very\n      droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in\n      height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient\n      to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car,\n      but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the\n      breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little\n      man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a\n      rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all,\n      although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally\n      protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more\n      properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His\n      hair was extremely gray, and collected into a queue behind. His nose was\n      prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant,\n      and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad,\n      puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a\n      semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little\n      gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight\n      breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest\n      was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily\n      on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk\n      handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner,\n      upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the\n      surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a\n      fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach\n      to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas\n      bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an\n      instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract\n      from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. This he\n      poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme\n      surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight. He at length opened\n      it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and\n      tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the\n      burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up.\n      But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no\n      farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make\n      busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a\n      portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he\n      threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their\n      contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of\n      the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty\n      times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed,\n      however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of\n      the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is said, on the contrary,\n      that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he\n      emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his\n      pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to\n      which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above\n      the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from\n      which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering\n      eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to\n      the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending\n      thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal\n      dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus\n      Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during his\n      circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject\n      of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to\n      have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to\n      himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official capacities of President\n      and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was\n      accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to\n      contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious,\n      communication:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and\n      Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city\n      of Rotterdam.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by\n      name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three\n      others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner\n      which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and\n      extremely unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I,\n      the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself. It\n      is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty\n      years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head\n      of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my\n      disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind—they,\n      as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative\n      profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late\n      years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics,\n      no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either\n      desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on\n      all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. But, as I was\n      saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches,\n      and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the\n      very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of\n      us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about\n      the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of\n      the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a\n      newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather\n      and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time,\n      there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need\n      of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of\n      things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife\n      and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and\n      I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of\n      putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure\n      for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till\n      night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger\n      against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular\n      who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door,\n      and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I internally vowed the\n      bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my\n      clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this\n      anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate\n      execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best,\n      however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair\n      words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance\n      should be afforded me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than\n      usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most\n      obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to\n      stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s stall. Seeing a chair close\n      at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and,\n      hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within\n      my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative\n      Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman\n      of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information on\n      matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the\n      contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to\n      a recollection of what was passing around me. By this time it began to\n      grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the treatise had made\n      an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky\n      streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes\n      unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There are some particular\n      passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary\n      manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the\n      interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my\n      education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects\n      connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of\n      my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust\n      the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a\n      farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps\n      reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in\n      ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect\n      possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of\n      instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity\n      itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected\n      as a legitimate source of falsity and error. In other words, I believed,\n      and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence,\n      superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses\n      where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found.\n      Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. In the\n      contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could\n      not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it\n      with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye\n      only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time\n      aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the\n      visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the\n      exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind,\n      came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I\n      have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and\n      forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the\n      epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star\n      offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force\n      of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course\n      which I afterwards pursued.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My mind,\n      however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried\n      in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to\n      escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the\n      bookseller’s stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in\n      the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having\n      arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their\n      perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I\n      thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals of this\n      period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had\n      given me so much annoyance. In this I finally succeeded—partly by\n      selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their\n      claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a\n      little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in\n      which I solicited their services. By these means—for they were\n      ignorant men—I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my\n      purpose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with\n      the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had\n      remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and\n      without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no\n      inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I\n      proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of\n      twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and\n      deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles\n      necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary\n      dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and\n      gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of\n      proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of\n      sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords;\n      bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some\n      important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally\n      known. I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired\n      situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty\n      gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three\n      inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of\n      a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name,\n      and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from\n      these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person\n      than myself—or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The\n      secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right\n      belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally\n      communicated to myself. The same individual submitted to me, without being\n      at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the\n      membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas\n      was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too\n      expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a\n      coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this\n      circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in\n      question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I\n      have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very\n      singular invention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy\n      respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole\n      two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet\n      in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for\n      the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In each of the five\n      smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the\n      larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder.\n      These—the keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner\n      with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of\n      about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask\n      over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and\n      barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and\n      placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there\n      secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the apparatus for\n      condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however, to\n      require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes\n      to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor and\n      unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my\n      preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than\n      forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated,\n      with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and\n      seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It had received three\n      coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the\n      purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in\n      relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the\n      bookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as\n      circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and\n      bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was what\n      people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without\n      my assistance. I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as\n      an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in\n      the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark night when I\n      bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three\n      creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with\n      the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the\n      other articles were deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I\n      proceeded immediately to business.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there\n      was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals,\n      rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning the\n      balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began\n      to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to\n      damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,\n      pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the\n      others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to\n      what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much\n      dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not\n      perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting\n      wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. I\n      began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily\n      believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the\n      devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it\n      should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether.\n      I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores\n      in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination.\n      To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation;\n      fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of\n      vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a\n      trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared\n      very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated.\n      I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it—not\n      forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a\n      large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is\n      contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair\n      of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high\n      time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if\n      by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of\n      igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before,\n      protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks.\n      This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and,\n      jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to\n      the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all\n      ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to\n      have carried up as many more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when,\n      roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous\n      manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and\n      legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my\n      very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car,\n      trembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had\n      entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the\n      shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I\n      felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately\n      thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly\n      through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I\n      afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme\n      violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause—my\n      situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. But at\n      the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The balloon at first\n      collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with\n      horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man,\n      hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling,\n      at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a\n      piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally\n      through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I\n      fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. It is impossible—utterly\n      impossible—to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation.\n      I gasped convulsively for breath—a shudder resembling a fit of the\n      ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame—I felt my eyes\n      starting from their sockets—a horrible nausea overwhelmed me—and\n      at length I fainted away.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must,\n      however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered\n      the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a\n      prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to\n      be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. My\n      sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with\n      agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient\n      madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation. I drew\n      up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what\n      occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the\n      horrible blackness of the fingernails. I afterward carefully examined my\n      head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I\n      succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half\n      suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in\n      both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a\n      toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not\n      being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me\n      that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim\n      consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind. But,\n      strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt\n      any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the\n      cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma;\n      and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question\n      susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the\n      profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of frequently\n      compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and\n      making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease\n      in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance.\n      Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great\n      caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the\n      large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles.\n      This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with\n      great difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some\n      trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find\n      them remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained\n      within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to\n      rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at\n      length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle,\n      and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist.\n      Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force,\n      I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car,\n      and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the\n      wicker-work.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of\n      about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was\n      therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from it,\n      I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of\n      situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car\n      considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the\n      most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that\n      when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my\n      face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it\n      actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was\n      suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a\n      crevice near the bottom of the car,—I say it may be readily\n      conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been\n      unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the\n      wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would have been utterly lost to\n      posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point\n      of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for,\n      perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making\n      the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil\n      state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly\n      away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of\n      utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so long accumulating in\n      the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my\n      spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their\n      proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my\n      perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the\n      self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness was,\n      luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my rescue\n      the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my\n      way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the\n      long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and\n      shuddering within the car.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently\n      to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then, however, examined\n      it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured. My\n      implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor\n      provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such\n      an accident was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found\n      it six o’clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a\n      present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me\n      in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape,\n      seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to\n      one of those childish toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear\n      upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship,\n      close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W.\n      Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun,\n      which had long arisen.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object\n      of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed\n      circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of\n      committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life itself I had any\n      positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the\n      adventitious miseries attending my situation. In this state of mind,\n      wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the\n      bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally made up my\n      mind. I determined to depart, yet live—to leave the world, yet\n      continue to exist—in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what\n      would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest I\n      should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as\n      well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an\n      achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and\n      incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond\n      the confines of the possible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be\n      attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the\n      two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial radii, or only about\n      237,000 miles. I say the mean or average interval, but it must be borne in\n      mind that the form of the moon’s orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity\n      amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse\n      itself, and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in\n      any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the\n      above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. But, to say\n      nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all\n      events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the\n      earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1,080, in all 5,080,\n      leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances,\n      of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary\n      distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate\n      of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be\n      anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322\n      days to reach the surface of the moon. There were, however, many\n      particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling\n      might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as\n      these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind,\n      I will mention them more fully hereafter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance.\n      From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions\n      from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left\n      below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that\n      at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000,\n      which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted\n      one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of\n      air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude\n      not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s diameter—that is,\n      not exceeding eighty miles—the rarefaction would be so excessive\n      that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the\n      most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the\n      atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did\n      not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether\n      on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical\n      laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called,\n      comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and,\n      at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be\n      essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance\n      from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of\n      course, be simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was\n      that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs\n      Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with\n      the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the\n      subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the\n      ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no\n      means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly\n      seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly\n      decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we\n      cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere\n      is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state\n      of infinite rarefaction.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been\n      wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the\n      atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a\n      circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for\n      such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their\n      creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the\n      intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its\n      perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the\n      disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the\n      periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the\n      comet’s ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular\n      decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose\n      a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal\n      medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a\n      medium must, in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its\n      centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the\n      sun’s attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and\n      the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is no\n      other way of accounting for the variation in question. But\n      again:—The real diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is\n      observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with\n      equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I not\n      justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of\n      volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I\n      have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its\n      solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the\n      zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so\n      apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric\n      lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally\n      the direction of the sun’s equator. It appeared to me evidently in\n      the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond\n      the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2)\n      Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the\n      comet’s ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It\n      was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of\n      our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the\n      planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by\n      considerations, so to speak, purely geological.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation.\n      Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the\n      same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the\n      very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to\n      condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration. This\n      would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed\n      spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object\n      intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if\n      I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period. This\n      brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the\n      earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate. Now, the\n      power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in\n      the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it\n      does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and\n      consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities\n      rapidly diminishing—I say, it does not appear at all reasonable\n      that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be\n      accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded\n      ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent;\n      although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on\n      account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and\n      varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed,\n      therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to\n      counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I now considered\n      that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and\n      provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we\n      denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference\n      at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it—that is to\n      say, in regard to my power of ascending—for the gas in the balloon\n      would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in\n      proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much\n      as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was,\n      would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound\n      whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of\n      gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares\n      of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I\n      should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the\n      earth’s attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance\n      with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with\n      more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some\n      little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to\n      any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great\n      uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with\n      bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing\n      more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.(*3)\n      This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable\n      that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until\n      terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their origin was to be\n      looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric\n      pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the\n      superficial blood-vessels—not in any positive disorganization of the\n      animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the\n      atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of\n      blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for default of this renovation,\n      I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in\n      a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called\n      breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of\n      respiration. In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become\n      habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain\n      would gradually diminish—and to endure them while they continued, I\n      relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no\n      means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar\n      voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so\n      apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly\n      unparalleled in the annals of mankind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles\n      and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and\n      found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was,\n      therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was glad of this,\n      for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for\n      reasons which will be explained in the sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily\n      inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever\n      in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had\n      taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance. These latter\n      being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in\n      picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the\n      car.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an elevation of\n      26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect seemed unbounded.\n      Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what\n      a great extent of the earth’s area I beheld. The convex surface of any\n      segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the\n      versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in my case,\n      the versed sine—that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath\n      me—was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of\n      sight above the surface. ‘As five miles, then, to eight thousand,’ would\n      express the proportion of the earth’s area seen by me. In other words, I\n      beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the\n      globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the\n      spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation. The\n      ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the\n      eastward. I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the\n      head, especially about the ears—still, however, breathing with\n      tolerable freedom. The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience\n      whatsoever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of\n      dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing\n      apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular\n      recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature\n      could be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best, however,\n      to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of\n      one hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above the\n      difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great\n      increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the\n      cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other,\n      and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of\n      ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the\n      broad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have\n      been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of\n      the night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it\n      was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning\n      abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the\n      strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the\n      hideous and unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had the\n      balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud—that is\n      to say—had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to\n      discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence.\n      Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which\n      must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained too\n      great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer indicated an\n      altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great\n      difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful;\n      and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length\n      discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of\n      my ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand\n      over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no\n      inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon\n      itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than I\n      had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very\n      imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three\n      five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus\n      obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a\n      highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly\n      proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a\n      spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a\n      measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a\n      gasping manner—bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and\n      ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed in\n      the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and,\n      with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car\n      as if under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great\n      rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my\n      agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death, and death\n      in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to\n      render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of\n      my life. I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence\n      of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found\n      that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already\n      clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent,\n      when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and\n      the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me\n      for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to\n      collect my faculties. In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the\n      experiment of losing blood. Having no lancet, however, I was constrained\n      to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally\n      succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my\n      penknife. The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a\n      sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin\n      full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless\n      did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but,\n      having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter\n      of an hour. At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from\n      absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a\n      quarter of my ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however, was\n      diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be\n      positively necessary to make use of my condenser. In the meantime, looking\n      toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I\n      discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of\n      my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens.\n      This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether\n      unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a\n      chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more\n      than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had\n      imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the\n      surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending\n      animal existence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be\n      found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must\n      consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as\n      a strong confirmation of my idea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles\n      above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate\n      of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would\n      have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the\n      ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals,\n      with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose;\n      but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected. I\n      breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and\n      each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the\n      chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for\n      immediate use.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful\n      indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I\n      could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which\n      every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already\n      to assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the\n      eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great\n      Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small\n      portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual\n      edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of\n      mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock\n      of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea,\n      dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread\n      itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire\n      mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the\n      horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the\n      mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars\n      were brilliantly visible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I\n      determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of them, a\n      beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the\n      wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him,\n      fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be\n      persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at last, and\n      threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however,\n      no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great\n      vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing\n      cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim,\n      but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and he fell\n      dead within the car. The other one did not prove so unfortunate. To\n      prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a\n      return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find\n      him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings\n      with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was\n      out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who\n      seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty\n      meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent\n      satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the\n      slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the\n      most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the\n      apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will require some\n      little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that\n      my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely\n      with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was\n      existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by\n      means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently\n      condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object in view I had\n      prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag.\n      In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a\n      manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole\n      bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the\n      ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached. Having\n      pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all\n      sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth,\n      by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work—in other\n      words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were\n      separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car\n      in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the\n      hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I therefore\n      undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by\n      the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the\n      upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops—not to the hoop, for\n      that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened—but\n      to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three\n      feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having\n      been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a\n      few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of\n      the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their\n      proper buttons. In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part\n      of the bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop\n      would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car\n      itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of\n      the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence;\n      but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in\n      themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole\n      weight was supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents\n      been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all\n      uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic,\n      and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles\n      prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course, to keep the bag\n      distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in\n      its proper situation. All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of\n      the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of\n      the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by\n      means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been\n      inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I\n      could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction. In\n      that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth\n      window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the\n      floor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but\n      having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on\n      account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the\n      consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects\n      situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter of little\n      consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the\n      balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight\n      inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge\n      to the windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large tube of the\n      condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of\n      gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere\n      circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the\n      machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with\n      the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being repeated several\n      times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the\n      purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space it would, in a short\n      time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact\n      with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the\n      car—the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below.\n      To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within\n      the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in\n      a gradual manner—the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then\n      closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had\n      supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I\n      had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside\n      the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I\n      could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some little\n      risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the\n      car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been\n      attached.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the\n      chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o’clock. During\n      the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible\n      distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the\n      negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of\n      putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. But having\n      at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my\n      invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease—and\n      indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in\n      a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto\n      tormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness\n      or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all\n      of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a greater part\n      of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had\n      actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured\n      for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the\n      effects of a deficient respiration.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At twenty minutes before nine o’clock—that is to say, a short time\n      prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its\n      limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was\n      one of an extended construction. It then indicated an altitude on my part\n      of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at\n      that time an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less than the\n      three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine\n      o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I\n      became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The\n      convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my\n      view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and\n      fro. I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than\n      ten miles above the level of the sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of\n      feathers through the valve. They did not float as I had expected; but\n      dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the\n      greatest velocity—being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did\n      not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being\n      able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so\n      prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere\n      was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually\n      fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been\n      surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “By ten o’clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate\n      attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going\n      upward with a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means\n      of ascertaining the progression of the increase. I suffered no pain or\n      uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any\n      period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining\n      the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere\n      within the chamber. This latter point I determined to attend to at regular\n      intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my\n      health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. In\n      the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations. Fancy revelled in the\n      wild and dreamy regions of the moon. Imagination, feeling herself for once\n      unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy\n      and unstable land. Now there were hoary and time-honored forests, and\n      craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses\n      without a bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where\n      no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and\n      slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all\n      silent and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into\n      another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary\n      line of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall\n      eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the\n      shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface\n      where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with\n      the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were\n      continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus\n      entombed. “This then,” I said thoughtfully, “is the very reason why the\n      waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the\n      hours run on.” But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of\n      my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too\n      frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths\n      of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility. Yet I would not\n      suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter\n      speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage\n      sufficient for my undivided attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere\n      within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and\n      kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very\n      much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a\n      difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted\n      very strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of\n      pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have\n      been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of\n      atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close\n      examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with\n      the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest\n      sign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for all this by\n      extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere\n      around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically\n      insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a\n      medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its\n      inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he\n      might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately\n      experienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an\n      awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family\n      of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued\n      experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through the valve, with\n      a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled\n      in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it\n      from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not\n      have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner.\n      Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second\n      between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total\n      disappearance with all that it contained. My good wishes followed it to\n      the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would\n      ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At six o’clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth’s visible area\n      to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with\n      great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in\n      view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not, however, until\n      long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine\n      the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated,\n      did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. It was evident that,\n      in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least\n      before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much\n      farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the\n      height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a\n      longer period. I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning\n      the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into\n      consideration the intervals of darkness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At ten o’clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of\n      the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it\n      may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am\n      now speaking. If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere\n      in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To breathe it for more than\n      an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even\n      this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous\n      consequences might ensue. The consideration of this dilemma gave me no\n      little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the\n      dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a\n      light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and\n      finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent. But this hesitation\n      was only momentary. I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom,\n      and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed\n      essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered\n      them habitual. It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but\n      I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened\n      at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. It would\n      require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the\n      fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of\n      arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question\n      which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its\n      solution. To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his\n      falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din\n      of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his\n      chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should\n      be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different\n      indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to\n      keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time. I\n      at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem,\n      was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal\n      to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now\n      attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent,\n      and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it\n      would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation\n      whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now\n      determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on board in kegs\n      containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior\n      of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them\n      tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other;\n      placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of\n      shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal\n      position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet\n      from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf—but made of thin\n      plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon this latter shelf,\n      and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher\n      was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher,\n      and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape.\n      This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few\n      experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the\n      water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would\n      fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. This, of\n      course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the\n      proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. Having arranged all\n      this, the rest of the plan is obvious. My bed was so contrived upon the\n      floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below\n      the mouth of the pitcher. It was evident, that, at the expiration of an\n      hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run\n      over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also\n      evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet,\n      could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure\n      consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the\n      soundest slumber in the world.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I\n      immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency\n      of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed. Punctually every\n      sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied\n      the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the\n      condenser, I retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to my\n      slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I\n      finally arose for the day, it was seven o’clock, and the sun had attained\n      many degrees above the line of my horizon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the\n      earth’s apparent convexity increased in a material degree. Below me in the\n      ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands. Far\n      away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant\n      line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in\n      supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My\n      curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther\n      to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed\n      directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my great elevation\n      would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could\n      wish. Much, however, might be ascertained. Nothing else of an\n      extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus all continued\n      in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible\n      vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an\n      overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed,\n      although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my\n      immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept\n      until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical\n      interruption.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the\n      singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea. It had\n      lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn,\n      being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye. The\n      islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon\n      to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of\n      sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter\n      opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more\n      apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance occurred, and\n      I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with\n      books.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly\n      the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in\n      darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again\n      saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct, and\n      appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was\n      evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could again\n      distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward,\n      but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any consequence\n      happened during the day. Went early to bed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate\n      distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to\n      the horizon in the north. It was evident that if the balloon held its\n      present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now\n      little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I\n      continued to near the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon very\n      suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth’s form\n      being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened\n      regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at length\n      overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the\n      object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing\n      it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there\n      could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. It was\n      there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I had\n      now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be\n      discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating\n      my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M.\n      on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same\n      day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred\n      that the balloon had now, at four o’clock in the morning of April the\n      seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above\n      the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear immense, but the\n      estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far\n      inferior to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the\n      earth’s major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like\n      a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator\n      itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your Excellencies may,\n      however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored\n      within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath\n      me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were\n      still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a\n      distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate\n      examination. Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and\n      exciting. Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with\n      slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these\n      regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to\n      extend. In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very\n      sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally,\n      becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a\n      circular centre, sharply defined, whose apparent diameter subtended at the\n      balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying\n      in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the\n      visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and\n      impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could be ascertained. By\n      twelve o’clock the circular centre had materially decreased in\n      circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon\n      passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the\n      direction of the equator.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth’s apparent diameter,\n      besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance. The\n      whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow,\n      and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye. My\n      view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the\n      vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I\n      could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. This\n      difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last\n      forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer\n      together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience\n      became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent.\n      Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above\n      the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was\n      holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. This\n      circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I\n      hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success. Indeed, the direction I had\n      hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident that,\n      had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my\n      arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at\n      only the small angle of 5° 8′ 48″.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 9th. To-day the earth’s diameter was greatly diminished, and the\n      color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon\n      kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M.,\n      over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o’clock this\n      morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no\n      manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted\n      resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience. It\n      is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first\n      instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined\n      all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover\n      nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an\n      occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of\n      accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great\n      anxiety and agitation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the\n      earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first time, in\n      that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full. It\n      now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber\n      sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the\n      direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the\n      most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former course, about the\n      twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an\n      acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day,\n      keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar\n      ellipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the\n      car was a consequence of this change of route—a vacillation which\n      prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the\n      loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon\n      the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion. Great\n      decrease in the earth’s apparent diameter, which now subtended from\n      the balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The\n      moon could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith. I still\n      continued in the plane of the ellipse, but made little progress to the\n      eastward.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth. To-day\n      I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was now\n      actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee—in\n      other words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to\n      the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth. The moon\n      itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view. Great\n      and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be\n      traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness. About twelve\n      o’clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling sound which\n      had so astonished me before. It now, however, continued for some moments,\n      and gathered intensity as it continued. At length, while, stupefied and\n      terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous\n      destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and\n      flaming mass of some material which I could not distinguish, came with a\n      voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon. When my\n      fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little\n      difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected\n      from that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all\n      probability, one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked\n      up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones for want of a better\n      appellation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each of\n      the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very small\n      portion of the moon’s disk protruding, as it were, on all sides beyond the\n      huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme; for I had now\n      little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the\n      labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive\n      degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion. Sleep was a\n      matter nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and my frame\n      trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human nature could endure\n      this state of intense suffering much longer. During the now brief interval\n      of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity, and the\n      frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will be\n      remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular\n      breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly\n      diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was\n      observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had noticed\n      an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes. What,\n      therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening from a brief and\n      disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at\n      finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in\n      volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent\n      angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate\n      idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with which I\n      was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My knees tottered\n      beneath me—my teeth chattered—my hair started up on end.\n      ‘The balloon, then, had actually burst!’ These were the first\n      tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: ‘The balloon had\n      positively burst!—I was falling—falling with the most\n      impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense\n      distance already so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten\n      minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth,\n      and be hurled into annihilation!’ But at length reflection came to\n      my relief. I paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was\n      impossible. I could not in any reason have so rapidly come down. Besides,\n      although I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a\n      speed by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so\n      horribly conceived. This consideration served to calm the perturbation of\n      my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its\n      proper point of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of\n      my senses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance,\n      between the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The\n      latter was indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon,\n      while the moon—the moon itself in all its glory—lay beneath\n      me, and at my feet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change\n      in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of the\n      adventure least susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement in\n      itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long actually\n      anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at\n      that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be\n      superseded by the attraction of the satellite—or, more precisely,\n      where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less\n      powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I arose from a\n      sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the contemplation of a\n      very startling phenomenon, and one which, although expected, was not\n      expected at the moment. The revolution itself must, of course, have taken\n      place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no means clear that, had\n      I even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been made\n      aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion—that is to say,\n      by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my person or about my\n      apparatus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my\n      situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty\n      of my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to the\n      contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon. It lay\n      beneath me like a chart—and although I judged it to be still at no\n      inconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined to my\n      vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness. The\n      entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body\n      of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most extraordinary\n      feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast\n      level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the\n      greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable\n      volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of\n      artificial than of natural protuberance. The highest among them does not\n      exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map\n      of the volcanic districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your\n      Excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy\n      description I might think proper to attempt. The greater part of them were\n      in a state of evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their\n      fury and their power, by the repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric\n      stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and\n      more appalling.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon’s apparent\n      bulk—and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to\n      fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of\n      my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the\n      existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the\n      bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too in\n      spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of\n      a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all. But,\n      in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke’s comet and\n      the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain\n      observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the moon when\n      two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset, before the dark\n      part was visible, and continued to watch it until it became visible. The\n      two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each\n      exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays,\n      before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible. Soon afterward, the\n      whole dark limb became illuminated. This prolongation of the cusps beyond\n      the semicircle, I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the\n      sun’s rays by the moon’s atmosphere. I computed, also, the height of the\n      atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to\n      produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth\n      when the moon is about 32° from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in\n      this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar\n      ray, to be 5,376 feet. My ideas on this topic had also received\n      confirmation by a passage in the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical\n      Transactions, in which it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter’s\n      satellites, the third disappeared after having been about 1″ or 2″ of time\n      indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb.(*4)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an atmosphere,\n      existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course, entirely\n      depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then, after all,\n      prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing better to\n      expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into atoms against\n      the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I had now every reason\n      to be terrified. My distance from the moon was comparatively trifling,\n      while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I\n      could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o’clock, the\n      surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited\n      to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of\n      an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe its\n      density considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was necessary\n      at the apparatus; and at twelve o’clock, with some hesitation, I ventured\n      to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done\n      so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from\n      around the car. As might have been expected, spasms and violent headache\n      were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full\n      of danger. But these and other difficulties attending respiration, as they\n      were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life, I determined\n      to endure as I best could, in consideration of my leaving them behind me\n      momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon. This approach,\n      however, was still impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly\n      certain that, although I had probably not been deceived in the expectation\n      of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I\n      had been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all\n      adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my\n      balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree as at\n      the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either planet\n      supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation. That it was not the\n      case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough; why it was\n      not so, can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological\n      disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At all events I was now\n      close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity.\n      I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing overboard first my ballast,\n      then my water-kegs, then my condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber,\n      and finally every article within the car. But it was all to no purpose. I\n      still fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile\n      from the surface. As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my\n      coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the balloon the car itself, which\n      was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the\n      net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as far as\n      the eye could reach, was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations,\n      ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city,\n      and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of\n      them uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to\n      render me assistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a\n      ludicrous manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set\n      a-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth\n      so lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull,\n      copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the\n      heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of\n      the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water could be discovered,\n      and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted with tropical\n      and equatorial zones.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great anxieties,\n      unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at length, on the\n      nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in safety at the\n      conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary, and the most\n      momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of\n      earth. But my adventures yet remain to be related. And indeed your\n      Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a\n      planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but\n      rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite,\n      with the world inhabited by man, I may have intelligence for the private\n      ear of the States’ College of Astronomers of far more importance than the\n      details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded.\n      This is, in fact, the case. I have much—very much which it would\n      give me the greatest pleasure to communicate. I have much to say of the\n      climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of\n      unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar\n      frigidity for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by\n      distillation like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the\n      point the farthest from it; of a variable zone of running water; of the\n      people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political institutions;\n      of their peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want\n      of ears, those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified;\n      of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech; of\n      their substitute for speech in a singular method of inter-communication;\n      of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in\n      the moon with some particular individual on the earth—a connection\n      analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the\n      satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the\n      inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the\n      inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your Excellencies—above\n      all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of\n      the moon—regions which, owing to the almost miraculous accordance of\n      the satellite’s rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution\n      about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God’s mercy, never\n      shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man. All this, and\n      more—much more—would I most willingly detail. But, to be\n      brief, I must have my reward. I am pining for a return to my family and to\n      my home; and as the price of any farther communication on my part—in\n      consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw upon many\n      very important branches of physical and metaphysical science—I must\n      solicit, through the influence of your honorable body, a pardon for the\n      crime of which I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my\n      departure from Rotterdam. This, then, is the object of the present paper.\n      Its bearer, an inhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and\n      properly instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your\n      Excellencies’ pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if\n      it can, in any manner, be obtained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies’ very humble servant,\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      “H<small>ANS</small> P<small>FAALL</small>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document, Professor\n      Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity\n      of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk having taken off his\n      spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot\n      both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel\n      in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There was no doubt\n      about the matter—the pardon should be obtained. So at least swore,\n      with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally thought the\n      illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother in science,\n      and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way home to\n      deliberate upon the measures to be adopted. Having reached the door,\n      however, of the burgomaster’s dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest\n      that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear—no doubt\n      frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam—the\n      pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would\n      undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of this observation\n      the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore at an end. Not so,\n      however, rumors and speculations. The letter, having been published, gave\n      rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of the over-wise even made\n      themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better\n      than a hoax. But hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a general\n      term for all matters above their comprehension. For my part, I cannot\n      conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation. Let us see\n      what they say:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Imprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial antipathies\n      to certain burgomasters and astronomers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Don’t understand at all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Secondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose\n      ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has been\n      missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Well—what of that?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Thirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon\n      were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been made in the\n      moon. They were dirty papers—very dirty—and Gluck, the\n      printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in\n      Rotterdam.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He was mistaken—undoubtedly—mistaken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Fourthly, That Hans Pfaall himself, the drunken villain, and the three\n      very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than\n      two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just\n      returned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Don’t believe it—don’t believe a word of it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Lastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought to\n      be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city of\n      Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world,—not\n      to mention colleges and astronomers in general,—are, to say the\n      least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than they\n      ought to be.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ~~~ End of Text ~~~\n    </p>\n<h3>Notes to Hans Pfaal</h3>\n<p>\n      (*1) NOTE—Strictly speaking, there is but little similarity between\n      the above sketchy trifle and the celebrated “Moon-Story” of Mr. Locke; but\n      as both have the character of <i>hoaxes</i> (although the one is in a tone\n      of banter, the other of downright earnest), and as both hoaxes are on the\n      same subject, the moon—moreover, as both attempt to give\n      plausibility by scientific detail—the author of “Hans Pfaall” thinks\n      it necessary to say, in <i>self-defence,</i> that his own <i>jeu d’esprit</i>\n      was published in the “Southern Literary Messenger” about three weeks\n      before the commencement of Mr. L’s in the “New York Sun.” Fancying a\n      likeness which, perhaps, does not exist, some of the New York papers\n      copied “Hans Pfaall,” and collated it with the “Moon-Hoax,” by way of\n      detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the other.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As many more persons were actually gulled by the “Moon-Hoax” than would be\n      willing to acknowledge the fact, it may here afford some little amusement\n      to show why no one should have been deceived-to point out those\n      particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to establish\n      its real character. Indeed, however rich the imagination displayed in this\n      ingenious fiction, it wanted much of the force which might have been given\n      it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy. That\n      the public were misled, even for an instant, merely proves the gross\n      ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an astronomical\n      nature.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The moon’s distance from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000 miles. If\n      we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens would bring the\n      satellite (or any distant object), we, of course, have but to divide the\n      distance by the magnifying or, more strictly, by the space-penetrating\n      power of the glass. Mr. L. makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times. By\n      this divide 240,000 (the moon’s real distance), and we have five miles and\n      five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all could be seen so\n      far; much less the minute points particularized in the story. Mr. L.\n      speaks about Sir John Herschel’s perceiving flowers (the Papaver rheas,\n      etc.), and even detecting the color and the shape of the eyes of small\n      birds. Shortly before, too, he has himself observed that the lens would\n      not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter;\n      but even this, as I have said, is giving the glass by far too great power.\n      It may be observed, in passing, that this prodigious glass is said to have\n      been molded at the glasshouse of Messrs. Hartley and Grant, in Dumbarton;\n      but Messrs. H. and G.‘s establishment had ceased operations for many years\n      previous to the publication of the hoax.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On page 13, pamphlet edition, speaking of “a hairy veil” over the eyes of\n      a species of bison, the author says: “It immediately occurred to the acute\n      mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance to protect\n      the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to\n      which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically\n      subjected.” But this cannot be thought a very “acute” observation of the\n      Doctor’s. The inhabitants of our side of the moon have, evidently, no\n      darkness at all, so there can be nothing of the “extremes” mentioned. In\n      the absence of the sun they have a light from the earth equal to that of\n      thirteen full unclouded moons.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The topography throughout, even when professing to accord with Blunt’s\n      Lunar Chart, is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart,\n      and even grossly at variance with itself. The points of the compass, too,\n      are in inextricable confusion; the writer appearing to be ignorant that,\n      on a lunar map, these are not in accordance with terrestrial points; the\n      east being to the left, etc.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Deceived, perhaps, by the vague titles, Mare Nubium, Mare Tranquillitatis,\n      Mare Faecunditatis, etc., given to the dark spots by former astronomers,\n      Mr. L. has entered into details regarding oceans and other large bodies of\n      water in the moon; whereas there is no astronomical point more positively\n      ascertained than that no such bodies exist there. In examining the\n      boundary between light and darkness (in the crescent or gibbous moon)\n      where this boundary crosses any of the dark places, the line of division\n      is found to be rough and jagged; but, were these dark places liquid, it\n      would evidently be even.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The description of the wings of the man-bat, on page 21, is but a literal\n      copy of Peter Wilkins’ account of the wings of his flying islanders. This\n      simple fact should have induced suspicion, at least, it might be thought.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On page 23, we have the following: “What a prodigious influence must our\n      thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an\n      embryo in the womb of time, the passive subject of chemical affinity!”\n       This is very fine; but it should be observed that no astronomer would have\n      made such remark, especially to any journal of Science; for the earth, in\n      the sense intended, is not only thirteen, but forty-nine times larger than\n      the moon. A similar objection applies to the whole of the concluding\n      pages, where, by way of introduction to some discoveries in Saturn, the\n      philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy account of that\n      planet—this to the “Edinburgh Journal of Science!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      But there is one point, in particular, which should have betrayed the\n      fiction. Let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals\n      upon the moon’s surface—what would first arrest the attention of an\n      observer from the earth? Certainly neither their shape, size, nor any\n      other such peculiarity, so soon as their remarkable <i>situation</i>. They\n      would appear to be walking, with heels up and head down, in the manner of\n      flies on a ceiling. The <i>real</i> observer would have uttered an instant\n      ejaculation of surprise (however prepared by previous knowledge) at the\n      singularity of their position; the <i>fictitious</i> observer has not even\n      mentioned the subject, but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such\n      creatures, when it is demonstrable that he could have seen only the\n      diameter of their heads!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It might as well be remarked, in conclusion, that the size, and\n      particularly the powers of the man-bats (for example, their ability to fly\n      in so rare an atmosphere—if, indeed, the moon have any), with most\n      of the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence, are at\n      variance, generally, with all analogical reasoning on these themes; and\n      that analogy here will often amount to conclusive demonstration. It is,\n      perhaps, scarcely necessary to add, that all the suggestions attributed to\n      Brewster and Herschel, in the beginning of the article, about “a\n      transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of vision,” etc.,\n      etc., belong to that species of figurative writing which comes, most\n      properly, under the denomination of rigmarole.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the\n      stars—a limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood.\n      If, indeed, the casting of large lenses were all that is required,\n      man’s ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task, and we\n      might have them of any size demanded. But, unhappily, in proportion to\n      the increase of size in the lens, and consequently of space-penetrating\n      power, is the diminution of light from the object, by diffusion of its\n      rays. And for this evil there is no remedy within human ability; for an\n      object is seen by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself,\n      whether direct or reflected. Thus the only “artificial” light\n      which could avail Mr. Locke, would be some artificial light which he\n      should be able to throw—not upon the “focal object of\n      vision,” but upon the real object to be viewed—to wit: upon\n      the moon. It has been easily calculated that, when the light proceeding\n      from a star becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural light\n      proceeding from the whole of the stars, in a clear and moonless night,\n      then the star is no longer visible for any practical purpose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Earl of Ross’s telescope, lately constructed in England, has a <i>speculum</i>\n      with a reflecting surface of 4,071 square inches; the Herschel telescope\n      having one of only 1,811. The metal of the Earl of Ross’s is 6 feet\n      diameter; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at the edges, and 5 at the centre. The\n      weight is 3 tons. The focal length is 50 feet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book, whose\n      title-page runs thus: “L’Homme dans la lvne ou le Voyage Chimerique fait\n      au Monde de la Lvne, nouellement decouvert par Dominique Gonzales,\n      Aduanturier Espagnol, autrem?t dit le Courier volant. Mis en notre\n      langve par J. B. D. A. Paris, chez Francois Piot, pres la Fontaine de\n      Saint Benoist. Et chez J. Goignard, au premier pilier de la grand’salle du\n      Palais, proche les Consultations, MDCXLVII.” Pp. 76.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The writer professes to have translated his work from the English of one\n      Mr. D’Avisson (Davidson?) although there is a terrible ambiguity in the\n      statement. “J’ en ai eu,” says he “l’original de Monsieur D’Avisson,\n      medecin des mieux versez qui soient aujourd’huy dans la cõnoissance\n      des Belles Lettres, et sur tout de la Philosophic Naturelle. Je lui ai\n      cette obligation entre les autres, de m’ auoir non seulement mis en main\n      ce Livre en anglois, mais encore le Manuscrit du Sieur Thomas D’Anan,\n      gentilhomme Eccossois, recommandable pour sa vertu, sur la version duquel\n      j’ advoue que j’ ay tiré le plan de la mienne.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      After some irrelevant adventures, much in the manner of Gil Blas, and\n      which occupy the first thirty pages, the author relates that, being ill\n      during a sea voyage, the crew abandoned him, together with a negro\n      servant, on the island of St. Helena. To increase the chances of\n      obtaining food, the two separate, and live as far apart as possible. This\n      brings about a training of birds, to serve the purpose of carrier-pigeons\n      between them. By and by these are taught to carry parcels of some\n      weight—and this weight is gradually increased. At length the idea\n      is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the birds, with\n      a view to raising the author himself. A machine is contrived for the\n      purpose, and we have a minute description of it, which is materially\n      helped out by a steel engraving. Here we perceive the Signor Gonzales,\n      with point ruffles and a huge periwig, seated astride something which\n      resembles very closely a broomstick, and borne aloft by a multitude of\n      wild swans <i>(ganzas)</i> who had strings reaching from their tails to\n      the machine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The main event detailed in the Signor’s narrative depends upon a very\n      important fact, of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the\n      end of the book. The <i>ganzas,</i> with whom he had become so familiar,\n      were not really denizens of St. Helena, but of the moon. Thence it had\n      been their custom, time out of mind, to migrate annually to some portion\n      of the earth. In proper season, of course, they would return home; and the\n      author, happening, one day, to require their services for a short voyage,\n      is unexpectedly carried straight tip, and in a very brief period arrives\n      at the satellite. Here he finds, among other odd things, that the people\n      enjoy extreme happiness; that they have no <i>law;</i> that they die\n      without pain; that they are from ten to thirty feet in height; that they\n      live five thousand years; that they have an emperor called Irdonozur; and\n      that they can jump sixty feet high, when, being out of the gravitating\n      influence, they fly about with fans.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general <i>philosophy</i> of the\n      volume.\n    </p>\n<p>\n“I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side of\nthe globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it\nthe larger they seemed. I have also me and the earth. As to the\nstars, <i>since there was no night where I was, they always had the same\nappearance; not brilliant, as usual, but pale, and very nearly like the\nmoon of a morning. </i>But few of them were visible, and these ten times\nlarger (as well as I could judge) than they seem to the inhabitants\nof the earth. The moon, which wanted two days of being full, was of a\nterrible bigness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n“I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side\nof the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it\nthe larger they seemed. I have also to inform you that, whether it was\ncalm weather or stormy, I found myself <i>always immediately between the\nmoon and the earth.</i> I<i> </i>was convinced of this for two reasons-because\nmy birds always flew in a straight line; and because whenever we\nattempted to rest, <i>we were carried insensibly around the globe of the\nearth. </i>For I admit the opinion of Copernicus, who maintains that it\nnever ceases to revolve <i>from the east to the west, </i>not upon the poles\nof the Equinoctial, commonly called the poles of the world, but upon\nthose of the Zodiac, a question of which I propose to speak more at\nlength here-after, when I shall have leisure to refresh my memory in\nregard to the astrology which I learned at Salamanca when young, and\nhave since forgotten.”\n </p>\n<p>\n      Notwithstanding the blunders italicized, the book is not without some\n      claim to attention, as affording a naive specimen of the current\n      astronomical notions of the time. One of these assumed, that the\n      “gravitating power” extended but a short distance from the earth’s\n      surface, and, accordingly, we find our voyager “carried insensibly around\n      the globe,” etc.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There have been other “voyages to the moon,” but none of higher merit than\n      the one just mentioned. That of Bergerac is utterly meaningless. In the\n      third volume of the “American Quarterly Review” will be found quite an\n      elaborate criticism upon a certain “journey” of the kind in question—a\n      criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic most exposes\n      the stupidity of the book, or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy. I\n      forget the title of the work; but the <i>means</i> of the voyage are more\n      deplorably ill conceived than are even the <i>ganzas</i> of our friend the\n      Signor Gonzales. The adventurer, in digging the earth, happens to discover\n      a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong attraction, and\n      straightway constructs of it a box, which, when cast loose from its\n      terrestrial fastenings, flies with him, forthwith, to the satellite. The\n      “Flight of Thomas O’Rourke,” is a <i>jeu d’ esprit</i> not altogether\n      contemptible, and has been translated into German. Thomas, the hero, was,\n      in fact, the gamekeeper of an Irish peer, whose eccentricities gave rise\n      to the tale. The “flight” is made on an eagle’s back, from Hungry Hill, a\n      lofty mountain at the end of Bantry Bay.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In these various <i>brochures</i> the aim is always satirical; the theme\n      being a description of Lunarian customs as compared with ours. In none is\n      there any effort at <i>plausibility</i> in the details of the voyage\n      itself. The writers seem, in each instance, to be utterly uninformed in\n      respect to astronomy. In “Hans Pfaall” the design is original, inasmuch as\n      regards an attempt at <i>verisimilitude,</i> in the application of\n      scientific principles (so far as the whimsical nature of the subject would\n      permit), to the actual passage between the earth and the moon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*2) The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes.\n      Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.—Pliny, lib. 2, p. 26.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*3) Since the original publication of Hans Pfaall, I find that Mr. Green,\n      of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny the assertions\n      of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing inconvenience,—precisely\n      in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*4) Hevelius writes that he has several times found, in skies perfectly\n      clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were\n      conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the moon, at the same\n      elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent telescope,\n      the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all times. From\n      the circumstances of the observation, it is evident that the cause of this\n      phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in the moon, or in the\n      eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in something (an atmosphere?)\n      existing about the moon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars, when\n      approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular figure changed\n      into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he found no alteration of\n      figure at all. Hence it might be supposed, that at some times and not at\n      others, there is a dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of\n      the stars are refracted.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap05\"></a>THE GOLD-BUG</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nWhat ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!<br>\nHe hath been bitten by the Tarantula.\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n<i>—All in the Wrong.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Many years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand. He\n      was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series\n      of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To avoid the mortification\n      consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his\n      forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island, near\n      Charleston, South Carolina.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This Island is a very singular one. It consists of little else than the\n      sea sand, and is about three miles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds\n      a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the main land by a scarcely\n      perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and\n      slime, a favorite resort of the marsh hen. The vegetation, as might be\n      supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are\n      to be seen. Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and\n      where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the\n      fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the\n      bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this\n      western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is\n      covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by\n      the horticulturists of England. The shrub here often attains the height\n      of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice,\n      burthening the air with its fragrance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more\n      remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which he\n      occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance. This soon\n      ripened into friendship—for there was much in the recluse to excite\n      interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual powers of\n      mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of\n      alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many books, but\n      rarely employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or\n      sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of shells or\n      entomological specimens—his collection of the latter might have\n      been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was usually\n      accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted\n      before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by\n      threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of\n      attendance upon the footsteps of his young “Massa Will.” It is not\n      improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat\n      unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into\n      Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s Island are seldom very\n      severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire\n      is considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18—, there\n      occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I\n      scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I\n      had not visited for several weeks—my residence being, at that time,\n      in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the island, while the\n      facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the\n      present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and\n      getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted,\n      unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.\n      It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an\n      overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\n      the arrival of my hosts.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.\n      Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some\n      marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits—how else\n      shall I term them?—of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve,\n      forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured,\n      with Jupiter’s assistance, a <i>scarabæus</i> which he believed to\n      be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on\n      the morrow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the\n      blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of <i>scarabæi</i> at the devil.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Legrand,\n      “but it’s so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee\n      that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others? As I was\n      coming home I met Lieutenant G——, from the fort, and, very\n      foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it\n      until the morning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at\n      sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What?—sunrise?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Nonsense! no!—the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color—about\n      the size of a large hickory-nut—with two jet black spots near one\n      extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The\n      <i>antennæ</i> are—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,” here\n      interrupted Jupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him,\n      inside and all, sep him wing—neber feel half so hebby a bug in my\n      life.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it\n      seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason for your letting\n      the birds burn? The color”—here he turned to me—“is really\n      almost enough to warrant Jupiter’s idea. You never saw a more brilliant\n      metallic lustre than the scales emit—but of this you cannot judge\n      till tomorrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.”\n       Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and\n      ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he drew from his\n      waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and\n      made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he did this, I retained\n      my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design was complete,\n      he handed it to me without rising. As I received it, a loud growl was\n      heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter opened it, and a\n      large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my\n      shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention\n      during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper,\n      and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my\n      friend had depicted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes,\n      “this <i>is</i> a strange <i>scarabæus</i>, I must confess: new to\n      me: never saw anything like it before—unless it was a skull, or a\n      death’s-head—which it more nearly resembles than anything\n      else that has come under <i>my</i> observation.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A death’s-head!” echoed Legrand. “Oh—yes—well, it has\n      something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black\n      spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth—and\n      then the shape of the whole is oval.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must wait\n      until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal\n      appearance.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, I don’t know,” said he, a little nettled, “I draw tolerably—<i>should</i>\n      do it at least—have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am\n      not quite a blockhead.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I, “this is a very\n      passable <i>skull</i>—indeed, I may say that it is a very <i>excellent</i> skull,\n      according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology—and\n      your <i>scarabæus</i> must be the queerest <i>scarabæus</i> in the world\n      if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of\n      superstition upon this hint. I presume you will call the bug <i>scarabæus\n      caput hominis</i>, or something of that kind—there are many similar\n      titles in the Natural Histories. But where are the <i>antennæ</i> you\n      spoke of?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The <i>antennæ!</i>” said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably\n      warm upon the subject; “I am sure you must see the <i>antennæ</i>. I made\n      them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is\n      sufficient.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have—still I don’t see them;” and\n      I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle\n      his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his\n      ill humor puzzled me—and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there\n      were positively <i>no antennæ</i> visible, and the whole <i>did</i> bear a very\n      close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it,\n      apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design\n      seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew\n      violently red—in another as excessively pale. For some minutes he\n      continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he\n      arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a\n      sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an\n      anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said\n      nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it\n      prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any\n      comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper\n      carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked. He\n      now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm\n      had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. As\n      the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from\n      which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my intention to\n      pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my\n      host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He did not press me\n      to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his\n      usual cordiality.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen\n      nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man,\n      Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited, and I\n      feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?—how is your master?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dar! dat’s it!—him neber ’plain of notin’—but him berry sick\n      for all dat.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Very</i> sick, Jupiter!—why didn’t you say so at once? Is he confined\n      to bed?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, dat he aint!—he aint ’fin’d nowhar—dat’s just whar de shoe\n      pinch—my mind is got to be berry hebby ’bout poor Massa Will.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about.\n      You say your master is sick. Hasn’t he told you what ails him?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, massa, ’taint worf while for to git mad about de matter—Massa\n      Will say noffin at all aint de matter wid him—but den what make him\n      go about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as\n      white as a gose? And den he keep a syphon all de time—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Keeps a what, Jupiter?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate—de queerest figgurs I\n      ebber did see. Ise gittin’ to be skeered, I tell you. Hab for to keep\n      mighty tight eye ’pon him ’noovers. Todder day he gib me slip ’fore de sun up\n      and was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick ready cut for\n      to gib him deuced good beating when he did come—but Ise sich a fool\n      dat I hadn’t de heart arter all—he look so berry poorly.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Eh?—what?—ah yes!—upon the whole I think you had better\n      not be too severe with the poor fellow—don’t flog him, Jupiter—he\n      can’t very well stand it—but can you form no idea of what has\n      occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct? Has anything\n      unpleasant happened since I saw you?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, massa, dey aint bin noffin onpleasant <i>since</i> den—‘twas <i>’fore</i> den\n      I’m feared—‘twas de berry day you was dare.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How? what do you mean?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, massa, I mean de bug—dare now.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The what?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “De bug,—I’m berry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere ’bout de\n      head by dat goole-bug.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too. I nebber did see sick a deuced bug—he\n      kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. Massa Will cotch him fuss,\n      but had for to let him go ’gin mighty quick, I tell you—den was de\n      time he must ha’ got de bite. I did n’t like de look oh de bug mouff,\n      myself, no how, so I would n’t take hold ob him wid my finger, but I cotch\n      him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up in de paper and stuff\n      piece ob it in he mouff—dat was de way.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle,\n      and that the bite made him sick?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I do n’t tink noffin about it—I nose it. What make him dream ’bout\n      de goole so much, if ’taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd ’bout\n      dem goole-bugs fore dis.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But how do you know he dreams about gold?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How I know? why ’cause he talk about it in he sleep—dat’s how I\n      nose.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am I\n      to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What de matter, massa?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me a note\n      which ran thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n      “M<small>Y</small> D<small>EAR</small> ——Why have I not\n      seen you for so long a time? I hope you have not been so foolish as to\n      take offence at any little <i>brusquerie</i> of mine; but no, that is\n      improbable. Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety. I have\n      something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I\n      should tell it at all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys me,\n      almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions. Would you believe\n      it?—he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which to\n      chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, <i>solus</i>,\n      among the hills on the main land. I verily believe that my ill looks alone\n      saved me a flogging.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter. <i>Do</i>\n      come. I wish to see you to-<i>night</i>, upon business of importance. I\n      assure you that it is of the <i>highest</i> importance.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n“Ever yours,<br>\n“W<small>ILLIAM</small> L<small>EGRAND</small>”.\n</p>\n<p>\n      There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great\n      uneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand. What\n      could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain?\n      What “business of the highest importance” could he possibly have to\n      transact? Jupiter’s account of him boded no good. I dreaded lest the\n      continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the\n      reason of my friend. Without a moment’s hesitation, therefore, I prepared\n      to accompany the negro.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all\n      apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to\n      embark.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Him syfe, massa, and spade.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Very true; but what are they doing here?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in de\n      town, and de debbil’s own lot of money I had to gib for ’em.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’\n      going to do with scythes and spades?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dat’s more dan <i>I</i> know, and debbil take me if I don’t b’lieve ’tis more dan\n      he know, too. But it’s all cum ob do bug.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole\n      intellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped into the boat\n      and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little\n      cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles\n      brought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon when we\n      arrived. Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation. He grasped my\n      hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the\n      suspicions already entertained. His countenance was pale even to\n      ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. After\n      some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better\n      to say, if he had yet obtained the <i>scarabæus</i> from Lieutenant\n      G——.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the next\n      morning. Nothing should tempt me to part with that <i>scarabæus</i>. Do\n      you know that Jupiter is quite right about it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In supposing it to be a bug of <i>real gold</i>.” He said this with an air of\n      profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a triumphant smile,\n      “to reinstate me in my family possessions. Is it any wonder, then, that I\n      prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only\n      to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the\n      index. Jupiter; bring me that <i>scarabæus!</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What! de bug, massa? I’d rudder not go fer trubble dat bug—you mus’\n      git him for your own self.” Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and\n      stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was\n      enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabæus, and, at that time, unknown\n      to naturalists—of course a great prize in a scientific point of\n      view. There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back,\n      and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and\n      glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the\n      insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I\n      could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make\n      of Legrand’s concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the life of\n      me, tell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed\n      my examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I might have your\n      counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My dear Legrand,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly unwell,\n      and had better use some little precautions. You shall go to bed, and I\n      will remain with you a few days, until you get over this. You are feverish\n      and—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Feel my pulse,” said he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of\n      fever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But you may be ill and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to prescribe\n      for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect to be\n      under the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you will\n      relieve this excitement.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And how is this to be done?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the\n      hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall need the aid\n      of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can trust.\n      Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive in me\n      will be equally allayed.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you mean to\n      say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into\n      the hills?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It has.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am sorry—very sorry—for we shall have to try it by\n      ourselves.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!—but stay!—how\n      long do you propose to be absent?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all\n      events, by sunrise.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours\n      is over, and the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,\n      you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of your\n      physician?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four o’clock—Legrand,\n      Jupiter, the dog, and myself. Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades—the\n      whole of which he insisted upon carrying—more through fear, it\n      seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his\n      master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance. His demeanor was\n      dogged in the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were the sole words which\n      escaped his lips during the journey. For my own part, I had charge of a\n      couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the <i>scarabæus</i>,\n      which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to\n      and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went. When I observed this\n      last, plain evidence of my friend’s aberration of mind, I could scarcely\n      refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at\n      least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures\n      with a chance of success. In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain,\n      to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition. Having succeeded\n      in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation\n      upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no\n      other reply than “we shall see!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff, and,\n      ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded in a\n      northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and\n      desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. Legrand led\n      the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to\n      consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon\n      a former occasion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just\n      setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen.\n      It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost inaccessible\n      hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge\n      crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were\n      prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by\n      the support of the trees against which they reclined. Deep ravines, in\n      various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with\n      brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been\n      impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction\n      of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an\n      enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon\n      the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had\n      then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread\n      of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance. When we\n      reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought\n      he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered by the question,\n      and for some moments made no reply. At length he approached the huge\n      trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention.\n      When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to see\n      what we are about.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Jupiter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to go—and\n      here—stop! take this beetle with you.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “De bug, Massa Will!—de goole-bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in\n      dismay—“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?—d—n if I do!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a\n      harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this string—but,\n      if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be under the\n      necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance;\n      “always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger. Was only funnin any how. <i>Me</i>\n      feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold of\n      the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his\n      person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In youth, the tulip-tree, or <i>Liriodendron Tulipferum</i>, the most magnificent\n      of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a\n      great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark\n      becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance\n      on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay\n      more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely\n      as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some\n      projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or\n      two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first\n      great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually\n      accomplished. The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although\n      the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Which way mus go now, Massa Will?” he asked.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Keep up the largest branch—the one on this side,” said Legrand. The\n      negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble;\n      ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be\n      obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. Presently his voice\n      was heard in a sort of halloo.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “How much fudder is got for go?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How high up are you?” asked Legrand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob de tree.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and\n      count the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you passed?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “One, two, tree, four, fibe—I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon\n      dis side.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Then go one limb higher.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh\n      limb was attained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evidently much excited, “I want you to work\n      your way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything\n      strange, let me know.” By this time what little doubt I might have\n      entertained of my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally at rest. I had\n      no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became\n      seriously anxious about getting him home. While I was pondering upon what\n      was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice was again heard.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far—’tis dead limb putty\n      much all de way.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering\n      voice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail—done up for sartain—done\n      departed dis here life.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the\n      greatest distress.\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word,\n      “why come home and go to bed. Come now!—that’s a fine\n      fellow. It’s getting late, and, besides, you remember your\n      promise.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very\n      rotten.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few moments, “but\n      not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb\n      by myself, dat’s true.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “By yourself!—what do you mean?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why I mean de bug. ’Tis <i>berry</i> hebby bug. Spose I drop him down fuss, and\n      den de limb won’t break wid just de weight ob one nigger.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You infernal scoundrel!” cried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what\n      do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you drop that\n      beetle I’ll break your neck. Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger dat style.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well! now listen!—if you will venture out on the limb as far as you\n      think safe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you a present of a silver\n      dollar as soon as you get down.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I’m gwine, Massa Will—deed I is,” replied the negro very promptly—“mos\n      out to the eend now.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Out to the end!</i>” here fairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are out to\n      the end of that limb?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Soon be to de eend, massa,—o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis\n      here pon de tree?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted, “what is it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why taint noffin but a skull—somebody bin lef him head up de tree,\n      and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A skull, you say!—very well—how is it fastened to the limb?—what\n      holds it on?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my\n      word—dare’s a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to\n      de tree.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you—do you hear?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, massa.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Pay attention, then—find the left eye of the skull.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no eye lef at all.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, I knows dat—knows all about dat—’tis my lef hand what I\n      chops de wood wid.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same side as\n      your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the skull, or\n      the place where the left eye has been. Have you found it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here was a long pause. At length the negro asked,\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull,\n      too?—cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all—nebber\n      mind! I got de lef eye now—here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach—but\n      be careful and not let go your hold of the string.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole—look\n      out for him dare below!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter’s person could be seen; but the\n      beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of\n      the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the last\n      rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the\n      eminence upon which we stood. The <i>scarabæus</i> hung quite clear of any\n      branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Legrand\n      immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three\n      or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having\n      accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from\n      the tree.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot\n      where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape\n      measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk, of the tree\n      which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and\n      thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the\n      two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet—Jupiter\n      clearing away the brambles with the scythe. At the spot thus attained a\n      second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about\n      four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade himself, and giving\n      one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set about digging as\n      quickly as possible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any\n      time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined\n      it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the\n      exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of\n      disturbing my poor friend’s equanimity by a refusal. Could I have\n      depended, indeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had no hesitation in\n      attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of\n      the old negro’s disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any\n      circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no doubt that\n      the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern\n      superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received\n      confirmation by the finding of the <i>scarabæus</i>, or, perhaps, by\n      Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining it to be “a bug of real gold.” A mind\n      disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions—especially\n      if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas—and then I called to\n      mind the poor fellow’s speech about the beetle’s being “the index of his\n      fortune.” Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I\n      concluded to make a virtue of necessity—to dig with a good will, and\n      thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the\n      fallacy of the opinions he entertained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a\n      more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and\n      implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed,\n      and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any\n      interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief\n      embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest\n      in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew\n      fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity—or,\n      rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand;—for myself, I should\n      have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the\n      wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by\n      Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation,\n      tied the brute’s mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned,\n      with a grave chuckle, to his task.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet,\n      and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general pause ensued,\n      and I began to hope that the farce was at an end. Legrand, however,\n      although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and\n      recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and\n      now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two\n      feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at\n      length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted\n      upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his\n      coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. In the mean\n      time I made no remark. Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to\n      gather up his tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we\n      turned in profound silence towards home.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud\n      oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. The\n      astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent, let fall\n      the spades, and fell upon his knees.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You scoundrel,” said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between his\n      clenched teeth—“you infernal black villain!—speak, I tell you!—answer\n      me this instant, without prevarication!—which—which is your\n      left eye?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared\n      the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision,\n      and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate\n      dread of his master’s attempt at a gouge.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I thought so!—I knew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting the\n      negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the\n      astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely,\n      from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Come! we must go back,” said the latter, “the game’s not up yet;” and he\n      again led the way to the tulip-tree.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Jupiter,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here! was the skull\n      nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the limb?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout\n      any trouble.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the\n      beetle?”—here Legrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “’Twas dis eye, massa—de lef eye—jis as you tell me,” and here\n      it was his right eye that the negro indicated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That will do—we must try it again.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw,\n      certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where\n      the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its\n      former position. Taking, now, the tape measure from the nearest point of\n      the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a\n      straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated,\n      removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former\n      instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades. I\n      was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the\n      change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor\n      imposed. I had become most unaccountably interested—nay, even\n      excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of\n      Legrand—some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\n      me. I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with\n      something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure,\n      the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. At a period\n      when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had\n      been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the\n      violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had\n      been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now\n      assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter’s again attempting to\n      muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore\n      up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few seconds he had uncovered\n      a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with\n      several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed\n      woollen. One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large\n      Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold\n      and silver coin came to light.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the\n      countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment. He urged\n      us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered\n      when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a\n      large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense\n      excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest\n      of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness, had\n      plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process—perhaps that of\n      the bi-chloride of mercury. This box was three feet and a half long, three\n      feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It was firmly secured by bands\n      of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open trelliswork over the\n      whole. On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron—six\n      in all—by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six\n      persons. Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer\n      very slightly in its bed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so\n      great a weight. Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two\n      sliding bolts. These we drew back—trembling and panting with\n      anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming\n      before us. As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed\n      upwards a glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels,\n      that absolutely dazzled our eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed. Amazement\n      was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement,\n      and spoke very few words. Jupiter’s countenance wore, for some minutes, as\n      deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro’s\n      visage to assume. He seemed stupefied—thunderstricken. Presently he\n      fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the\n      elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a\n      bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug! de poor little\n      goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed ob\n      yourself, nigger?—answer me dat!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet\n      to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and it\n      behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before\n      daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done, and much time was\n      spent in deliberation—so confused were the ideas of all. We,\n      finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we\n      were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The articles\n      taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard\n      them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir\n      from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return. We then hurriedly\n      made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after\n      excessive toil, at one o’clock in the morning. Worn out as we were, it was\n      not in human nature to do more immediately. We rested until two, and had\n      supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three\n      stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises. A little before\n      four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally\n      as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for\n      the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens,\n      just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the\n      tree-tops in the East.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time\n      denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours’\n      duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our\n      treasure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the\n      greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had\n      been nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped in\n      promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed\n      of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In coin there was\n      rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars—estimating\n      the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the\n      period. There was not a particle of silver. All was gold of antique date\n      and of great variety—French, Spanish, and German money, with a few\n      English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens\n      before. There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we\n      could make nothing of their inscriptions. There was no American money. The\n      value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating. There were\n      diamonds—some of them exceedingly large and fine—a hundred and\n      ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable\n      brilliancy;—three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and\n      twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken from\n      their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings themselves,\n      which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been\n      beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification. Besides all this,\n      there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments; nearly two\n      hundred massive finger and earrings; rich chains—thirty of\n      these, if I remember; eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; five\n      gold censers of great value; a prodigious golden punch bowl,\n      ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with\n      two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles\n      which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables exceeded three\n      hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not\n      included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the\n      number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. Many of them were\n      very old, and as timekeepers valueless; the works having suffered, more\n      or less, from corrosion—but all were richly jewelled and in cases of\n      great worth. We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at\n      a million and a half of dollars; and upon the subsequent disposal of the\n      trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found\n      that we had greatly undervalued the treasure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense\n      excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw\n      that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most\n      extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances\n      connected with it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough sketch I\n      had made of the <i>scarabæus</i>. You recollect also, that I became quite\n      vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death’s-head. When\n      you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I\n      called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted\n      to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact. Still, the\n      sneer at my graphic powers irritated me—for I am considered a good\n      artist—and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I\n      was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to\n      be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be\n      a piece of very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember. Well, as\n      I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch\n      at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I\n      perceived, in fact, the figure of a death’s-head just where, it seemed to\n      me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For a moment I was too much\n      amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my design was very different in\n      detail from this—although there was a certain similarity in general\n      outline. Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of\n      the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning\n      it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My\n      first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of\n      outline—at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that\n      unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the\n      parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the <i>scarabæus</i>, and that\n      this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble\n      my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied\n      me for a time. This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind\n      struggles to establish a connexion—a sequence of cause and effect—and,\n      being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when\n      I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction\n      which startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began distinctly,\n      positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment\n      when I made my sketch of the <i>scarabæus</i>. I became perfectly certain\n      of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other,\n      in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I\n      could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt\n      it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed to\n      glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my\n      intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night’s\n      adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. I arose at once, and\n      putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection\n      until I should be alone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a\n      more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place I\n      considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession.\n      The spot where we discovered the <i>scarabæus</i> was on the coast of the main\n      land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above\n      high water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which\n      caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before\n      seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a\n      leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it. It was at\n      this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of\n      parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half buried in\n      the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found it, I\n      observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship’s\n      long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for\n      the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave\n      it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met\n      Lieutenant G——. I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take\n      it to the fort. Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his\n      waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and\n      which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection. Perhaps he\n      dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize\n      at once—you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected\n      with Natural History. At the same time, without being conscious of it, I\n      must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a\n      sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. I looked\n      in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets, hoping to find\n      an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment. I thus detail the\n      precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances\n      impressed me with peculiar force.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No doubt you will think me fanciful—but I had already established a\n      kind of connexion. I had put together two links of a great chain. There\n      was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a\n      parchment—not a paper—with a skull depicted upon it. You will,\n      of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’ I reply that the skull, or\n      death’s-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the\n      death’s head is hoisted in all engagements.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. Parchment is\n      durable—almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely\n      consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing\n      or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection\n      suggested some meaning—some relevancy—in the death’s-head. I\n      did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. Although one of\n      its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that\n      the original form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might\n      have been chosen for a memorandum—for a record of something to be\n      long remembered and carefully preserved.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was not upon the parchment\n      when you made the drawing of the beetle. How then do you trace any\n      connexion between the boat and the skull—since this latter,\n      according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows\n      how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the <i>scarabæus?</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point,\n      I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were sure, and\n      could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example, thus: When I\n      drew the <i>scarabæus</i>, there was no skull apparent upon the parchment.\n      When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and observed you\n      narrowly until you returned it. You, therefore, did not design the skull,\n      and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not done by human\n      agency. And nevertheless it was done.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did\n      remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about\n      the period in question. The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy\n      accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth. I was heated with\n      exercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close to\n      the chimney. Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were\n      in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped\n      upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and kept him\n      off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall\n      listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire. At one\n      moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you,\n      but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its\n      examination. When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a\n      moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, upon the\n      parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it. You are well aware that\n      chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means\n      of which it is possible to write upon either paper or vellum, so that the\n      characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire.\n      Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of\n      water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. The regulus of cobalt,\n      dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These colors disappear at\n      longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools, but\n      again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I now scrutinized the death’s-head with care. Its outer edges—the\n      edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum—were far more\n      distinct than the others. It was clear that the action of the caloric had\n      been imperfect or unequal. I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected\n      every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first, the only\n      effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, upon\n      persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the\n      slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death’s-head was\n      delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat. A closer\n      scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you—a\n      million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth—but\n      you are not about to establish a third link in your chain—you will\n      not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goat—pirates,\n      you know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming\n      interest.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, a kid then—pretty much the same thing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Legrand. “You may have heard of\n      one Captain Kidd. I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind\n      of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature; because its\n      position upon the vellum suggested this idea. The death’s-head at the\n      corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp,\n      or seal. But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else—of the\n      body to my imagined instrument—of the text for my context.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the\n      signature.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a\n      presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can scarcely say why.\n      Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief;—but\n      do you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about the bug being of solid gold,\n      had a remarkable effect upon my fancy? And then the series of accidents\n      and coincidences—these were so very extraordinary. Do you observe\n      how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon\n      the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently\n      cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without the intervention of\n      the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared, I should never have\n      become aware of the death’s-head, and so never the possessor of the\n      treasure?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But proceed—I am all impatience.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current—the\n      thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the\n      Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates. These rumors must have had\n      some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so\n      continuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\n      circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed. Had Kidd\n      concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors\n      would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form. You will\n      observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about\n      money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would\n      have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident—say the loss of a\n      memorandum indicating its locality—had deprived him of the means of\n      recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his followers,\n      who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at\n      all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts, to\n      regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the\n      reports which are now so common. Have you ever heard of any important\n      treasure being unearthed along the coast?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Never.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But that Kidd’s accumulations were immense, is well known. I took it for\n      granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will scarcely\n      be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly amounting to\n      certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved a lost record\n      of the place of deposit.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But how did you proceed?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but\n      nothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might\n      have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the parchment\n      by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I placed it in a tin\n      pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted\n      charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I\n      removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in\n      several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines. Again\n      I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain another minute. Upon\n      taking it off, the whole was just as you see it now.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to my\n      inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red tint,\n      between the death’s-head and the goat:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     “53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;1‡(;:‡*8†83(88)5*†<br>\n     ;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*—4)8¶8*;4069285);)<br>\n     6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4(‡?3<br>\n     4;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;”\n </p>\n<p>\n      “But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark as ever.\n      Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my solution of this\n      enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And yet,” said Legrand, “the solution is by no means so difficult as you\n      might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the\n      characters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a\n      cipher—that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is\n      known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the\n      more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a\n      simple species—such, however, as would appear, to the crude\n      intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And you really solved it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times\n      greater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to take\n      interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human\n      ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may\n      not, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having once established\n      connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere\n      difficulty of developing their import.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In the present case—indeed in all cases of secret writing—the\n      first question regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of\n      solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned,\n      depend upon, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. In\n      general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by\n      probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution,\n      until the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us, all\n      difficulty was removed by the signature. The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is\n      appreciable in no other language than the English. But for this\n      consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French,\n      as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have\n      been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it was, I assumed the\n      cryptograph to be English.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You observe there are no divisions between the words. Had there been\n      divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy. In such case I\n      should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words,\n      and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely, (a or I,\n      for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured. But, there\n      being no division, my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters,\n      as well as the least frequent. Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Of the character 8 there are 33.\n    </p>\n<pre>                          ;        “     26.\n                          4        “     19.\n                        ‡ )        “     16.\n                          *        “     13.\n                          5        “     12.\n                          6        “     11.\n                        † 1        “      8.\n                          0        “      6.\n                        9 2        “      5.\n                        : 3        “      4.\n                          ?        “      3.\n                          ¶        “      2.\n                         -.        “      1.\n</pre>\n<p>\n      “Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e.\n      Afterwards, succession runs thus: <i>a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k\n      p q x z</i>. <i>E</i> predominates so remarkably that an individual\n      sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing\n      character.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Here, then, we leave, in the very beginning, the groundwork for something\n      more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of the table is\n      obvious—but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very partially\n      require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we will commence by\n      assuming it as the <i>e</i> of the natural alphabet. To verify the\n      supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples—for <i>e</i>\n      is doubled with great frequency in English—in such words, for\n      example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’ ‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’ ‘agree,’ &amp;c. In\n      the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times, although\n      the cryptograph is brief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us assume 8, then, as <i>e</i>. Now, of all <i>words</i> in the\n      language, ‘the’ is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are\n      not repetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation,\n      the last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters, so\n      arranged, they will most probably represent the word ‘the.’ Upon\n      inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters\n      being ;48. We may, therefore, assume that ; represents <i>t</i>, 4\n      represents <i>h</i>, and 8 represents <i>e</i>—the last being now\n      well confirmed. Thus a great step has been taken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a\n      vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and\n      terminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last\n      instance but one, in which the combination ;48 occurs—not far from\n      the end of the cipher. We know that the ; immediately ensuing is the\n      commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this ‘the,’\n      we are cognizant of no less than five.

But be assured that the specimen before us appertains\n      to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It now only remains to give\n      you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment, as\n      unriddled. Here it is:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘<i>A good glass in the bishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one\n      degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh\n      limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head a bee line from\n      the tree through the shot fifty feet out</i>.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever. How\n      is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about ‘devil’s\n      seats,’ ‘death’s heads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I confess,” replied Legrand, “that the matter still wears a serious\n      aspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was to\n      divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the\n      cryptographist.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You mean, to punctuate it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Something of that kind.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But how was it possible to effect this?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words\n      together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution.\n      Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object, would be nearly\n      certain to overdo the matter. When, in the course of his composition, he\n      arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause,\n      or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this\n      place, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in\n      the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual\n      crowding. Acting upon this hint, I made the division thus: ‘A good glass\n      in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s seat—forty-one degrees and\n      thirteen minutes—northeast and by north—main branch seventh\n      limb east side—shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head—a\n      bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It left me also in the dark,” replied Legrand, “for a few days; during\n      which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s Island,\n      for any building which went by the name of the ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of\n      course, I dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ Gaining no information on\n      the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and\n      proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into\n      my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ might have some\n      reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of\n      mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to\n      the northward of the island. I accordingly went over to the plantation,\n      and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place. At\n      length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a\n      place as Bessop’s Castle, and thought that she could guide me to it, but\n      that it was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she\n      consented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much\n      difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place. The\n      ‘castle’ consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks—one\n      of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its\n      insulated and artificial appearance. I clambered to its apex, and then felt\n      much at a loss as to what should be next done.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the\n      eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which I\n      stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a\n      foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it gave it a rude\n      resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. I\n      made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s seat’ alluded to in the MS., and\n      now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a\n      telescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other sense by\n      seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a\n      definite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it. Nor\n      did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, ‘forty-one degrees and\n      thirteen minutes,’ and ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended as\n      directions for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited by these\n      discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the\n      rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to\n      retain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This fact\n      confirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of course,\n      the ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to nothing but\n      elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was\n      clearly indicated by the words, ‘northeast and by north.’ This latter\n      direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then,\n      pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation\n      as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my\n      attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a\n      large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance. In the centre of\n      this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish\n      what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now\n      made it out to be a human skull.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved;\n      for the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’ could refer only to\n      the position of the skull upon the tree, while ‘shoot from the left eye of\n      the death’s head’ admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to\n      a search for buried treasure. I perceived that the design was to drop a\n      bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other\n      words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through\n      ‘the shot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a\n      distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point—and beneath\n      this point I thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay\n      concealed.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still\n      simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop’s Hotel, what then?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned homewards.\n      The instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’ however, the circular rift\n      vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would.\n      What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact\n      (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that the circular\n      opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than\n      that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’ I had been attended by\n      Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction\n      of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me alone. But, on the\n      next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give him the slip, and\n      went into the hills in search of the tree. After much toil I found it.\n      When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging. With\n      the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt at\n      digging, through Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug fall through the\n      right instead of through the left eye of the skull.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half\n      in the ‘shot’—that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest the\n      tree; and had the treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the error would have\n      been of little moment; but ‘the shot,’ together with the nearest point of\n      the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of a line of\n      direction; of course the error, however trivial in the beginning,\n      increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty\n      feet, threw us quite off the scent. But for my deep-seated impressions\n      that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all\n      our labor in vain.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle—how\n      excessively odd! I was sure you were mad. And why did you insist upon\n      letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions\n      touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way,\n      by a little bit of sober mystification. For this reason I swung the\n      beetle, and for this reason I let it fall it from the tree. An observation\n      of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me. What\n      are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself. There\n      seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them—and\n      yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would\n      imply. It is clear that Kidd—if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure,\n      which I doubt not—it is clear that he must have had assistance in\n      the labor. But this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to\n      remove all participants in his secret. Perhaps a couple of blows with a\n      mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit;\n      perhaps it required a dozen—who shall tell?”\n     </p>\n",

This honor is, however, more properly attributable to\n      Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. And, indeed, the character of the Syrian\n      monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious embellishment.\n      His accession to the throne, or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty,\n      a hundred and seventy-one years before the coming of Christ; his attempt\n      to plunder the temple of Diana at Ephesus; his implacable hostility to the\n      Jews; his pollution of the Holy of Holies; and his miserable death at\n      Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven years, are circumstances of a\n      prominent kind, and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of\n      his time than the impious, dastardly, cruel, silly, and whimsical\n      achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and\n      reputation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Let us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the world three\n      thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a few minutes, imagine\n      ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man, the remarkable city of\n      Antioch. To be sure there were, in Syria and other countries, sixteen\n      cities of that appellation, besides the one to which I more particularly\n      allude. But ours is that which went by the name of Antiochia Epidaphne,\n      from its vicinity to the little village of Daphne, where stood a temple to\n      that divinity. It was built (although about this matter there is some\n      dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the country after\n      Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus, and became\n      immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy. In the flourishing times\n      of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the\n      eastern provinces; and many of the emperors of the queen city (among whom\n      may be mentioned, especially, Verus and Valens) spent here the greater\n      part of their time. But I perceive we have arrived at the city itself. Let\n      us ascend this battlement, and throw our eyes upon the town and\n      neighboring country.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with innumerable\n      falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and finally through the\n      wilderness of buildings?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      That is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the exception\n      of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad mirror, about twelve\n      miles off to the southward. Every one has seen the Mediterranean; but let\n      me tell you, there are few who have had a peep at Antioch. By few, I mean,\n      few who, like you and me, have had, at the same time, the advantages of a\n      modern education. Therefore cease to regard that sea, and give your whole\n      attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us. You will remember\n      that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and\n      thirty. Were it later—for example, were it the year of our Lord\n      eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be deprived of this\n      extraordinary spectacle. In the nineteenth century Antioch is—that\n      is to say, Antioch will be—in a lamentable state of decay. It will\n      have been, by that time, totally destroyed, at three different periods, by\n      three successive earthquakes. Indeed, to say the truth, what little of its\n      former self may then remain, will be found in so desolate and ruinous a\n      state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to Damascus.\n      This is well. I see you profit by my advice, and are making the most of\n      your time in inspecting the premises—in\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      —satisfying your eyes<br>\n      With the memorials and the things of fame<br>\n      That most renown this city.—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish for\n      seventeen hundred and fifty years to come. But does not the appearance of\n      Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature\n      as to art.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Very true.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There are.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear comparison\n      with the most lauded of antiquity.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      All this I must acknowledge. Still there is an infinity of mud huts, and\n      abominable hovels. We cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in every\n      kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering fumes of idolatrous\n      incense, I have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench. Did you\n      ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously\n      tall? What gloom their shadows cast upon the ground! It is well the\n      swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the\n      day; we should otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in the time of her\n      desolation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is certainly a strange place! What is the meaning of yonder singular\n      building? See! it towers above all others, and lies to the eastward of\n      what I take to be the royal palace!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      That is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under the title\n      of Elah Gabalah. Hereafter a very notorious Roman Emperor will institute\n      this worship in Rome, and thence derive a cognomen, Heliogabalus. I dare\n      say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the temple. You need\n      not look up at the heavens; his Sunship is not there—at least not\n      the Sunship adored by the Syrians. That deity will be found in the\n      interior of yonder building. He is worshipped under the figure of a large\n      stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid, whereby is\n      denoted Fire.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hark—behold!—who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked,\n      with their faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the rabble?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Some few are mountebanks. Others more particularly belong to the race of\n      philosophers. The greatest portion, however—those especially who\n      belabor the populace with clubs—are the principal courtiers of the\n      palace, executing as in duty bound, some laudable comicality of the\n      king’s.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But what have we here? Heavens! the town is swarming with wild beasts!\n      How terrible a spectacle!—how dangerous a peculiarity!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Terrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous. Each\n      animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very quietly,\n      in the wake of its master. Some few, to be sure, are led with a rope about\n      the neck, but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species. The lion, the\n      tiger, and the leopard are entirely without restraint. They have been\n      trained without difficulty to their present profession, and attend upon\n      their respective owners in the capacity of valets-de-chambre. It is true,\n      there are occasions when Nature asserts her violated dominions;—but\n      then the devouring of a man-at-arms, or the throttling of a consecrated\n      bull, is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in\n      Epidaphne.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But what extraordinary tumult do I hear? Surely this is a loud noise even\n      for Antioch! It argues some commotion of unusual interest.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Yes—undoubtedly. The king has ordered some novel spectacle—some\n      gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome—or perhaps the massacre of\n      the Scythian prisoners—or the conflagration of his new palace—or\n      the tearing down of a handsome temple—or, indeed, a bonfire of a few\n      Jews. The uproar increases. Shouts of laughter ascend the skies. The air\n      becomes dissonant with wind instruments, and horrible with clamor of a\n      million throats. Let us descend, for the love of fun, and see what is\n      going on! This way—be careful! Here we are in the principal street,\n      which is called the street of Timarchus. The sea of people is coming this\n      way, and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide. They are pouring\n      through the alley of Heraclides, which leads directly from the palace;—therefore\n      the king is most probably among the rioters. Yes—I hear the shouts\n      of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the\n      East. We shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of\n      Ashimah. Let us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary; he\n      will be here anon. In the meantime let us survey this image. What is it?\n      Oh! it is the god Ashimah in proper person. You perceive, however, that he\n      is neither a lamb, nor a goat, nor a satyr, neither has he much\n      resemblance to the Pan of the Arcadians. Yet all these appearances have\n      been given—I beg pardon—will be given—by the learned of\n      future ages, to the Ashimah of the Syrians. Put on your spectacles, and\n      tell me what it is. What is it?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Bless me! it is an ape!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      True—a baboon; but by no means the less a deity. His name is a\n      derivation of the Greek Simia—what great fools are antiquarians! But\n      see!—see!—yonder scampers a ragged little urchin. Where is he\n      going? What is he bawling about? What does he say? Oh! he says the king is\n      coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that he has just finished\n      putting to death, with his own hand, a thousand chained Israelitish\n      prisoners! For this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies!\n      Hark! here comes a troop of a similar description. They have made a Latin\n      hymn upon the valor of the king, and are singing it as they go:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Mille, mille, mille,<br>\n      Mille, mille, mille,<br>\n      Decollavimus, unus homo!<br>\n      Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!<br>\n      Mille, mille, mille,<br>\n      Vivat qui mille mille occidit!<br>\n      Tantum vini habet nemo<br>\n      Quantum sanguinis effudit!(*1)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Which may be thus paraphrased:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,<br>\n      A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,<br>\n      We, with one warrior, have slain!<br>\n      A thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.<br>\n      Sing a thousand over again!<br>\n      Soho!—let us sing<br>\n      Long life to our king,<br>\n      Who knocked over a thousand so fine!<br>\n      Soho!—let us roar,<br>\n      He has given us more<br>\n      Red gallons of gore<br>\n      Than all Syria can furnish of wine!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Yes—the king is coming! See! the people are aghast with admiration, and\n      lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence. He comes!—he is\n      coming!—there he is!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Who?—where?—the king?—do not behold him—cannot\n      say that I perceive him.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Then you must be blind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Very possible. Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and\n      madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic\n      cameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal’s hoofs. See!\n      the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over—and another—and\n      another—and another. Indeed, I cannot help admiring the animal for\n      the excellent use he is making of his feet.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Rabble, indeed!—why these are the noble and free citizens of\n      Epidaphne! Beasts, did you say?—take care that you are not\n      overheard. Do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man?\n      Why, my dear sir, that cameleopard is no other than Antiochus Epiphanes,\n      Antiochus the Illustrious, King of Syria, and the most potent of all the\n      autocrats of the East! It is true, that he is entitled, at times,\n      Antiochus Epimanes—Antiochus the madman—but that is because\n      all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits. It is also\n      certain that he is at present ensconced in the hide of a beast, and is\n      doing his best to play the part of a cameleopard; but this is done for the\n      better sustaining his dignity as king. Besides, the monarch is of gigantic\n      stature, and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large. We\n      may, however, presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion\n      of especial state. Such, you will allow, is the massacre of a thousand\n      Jews. With how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours!\n      His tail, you perceive, is held aloft by his two principal concubines,\n      Elline and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be infinitely\n      prepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his eyes, which will\n      certainly start out of his head, and the queer color of his face, which\n      has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed. Let us\n      follow him to the hippodrome, whither he is proceeding, and listen to the\n      song of triumph which he is commencing:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Who is king but Epiphanes?<br>\n      Say—do you know?<br>\n      Who is king but Epiphanes?<br>\n      Bravo!—bravo!<br>\n      There is none but Epiphanes,<br>\n      No—there is none:<br>\n      So tear down the temples,<br>\n      And put out the sun!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Well and strenuously sung! The populace are hailing him ‘Prince of Poets,’\n      as well as ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and ‘Most\n      Remarkable of Cameleopards.’ They have encored his effusion, and do you\n      hear?—he is singing it over again. When he arrives at the\n      hippodrome, he will be crowned with the poetic wreath, in anticipation of\n      his victory at the approaching Olympics.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But, good Jupiter! what is the matter in the crowd behind us?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Behind us, did you say?—oh! ah!—I perceive. My friend, it is\n      well that you spoke in time. Let us get into a place of safety as soon as\n      possible. Here!—let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this\n      aqueduct, and I will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion.\n      It has turned out as I have been anticipating. The singular appearance of\n      the cameleopard and the head of a man, has, it seems, given offence to the\n      notions of propriety entertained, in general, by the wild animals\n      domesticated in the city. A mutiny has been the result; and, as is usual\n      upon such occasions, all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the\n      mob. Several of the Syrians have already been devoured; but the general\n      voice of the four-footed patriots seems to be for eating up the\n      cameleopard. ‘The Prince of Poets,’ therefore, is upon his hinder legs,\n      running for his life. His courtiers have left him in the lurch, and his\n      concubines have followed so excellent an example. ‘Delight of the\n      Universe,’ thou art in a sad predicament! ‘Glory of the East,’ thou art in\n      danger of mastication! Therefore never regard so piteously thy tail; it\n      will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this there is no help.\n      Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable degradation; but take\n      courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud for the hippodrome! Remember\n      that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus the Illustrious!—also\n      ‘Prince of Poets,’ ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and\n      ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards!’ Heavens! what a power of speed thou art\n      displaying! What a capacity for leg-bail thou art developing! Run, Prince!—Bravo,\n      Epiphanes! Well done, Cameleopard!—Glorious Antiochus!—He\n      runs!—he leaps!—he flies! Like an arrow from a catapult he\n      approaches the hippodrome! He leaps!—he shrieks!—he is there!\n      This is well; for hadst thou, ‘Glory of the East,’ been half a second\n      longer in reaching the gates of the Amphitheatre, there is not a bear’s\n      cub in Epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at thy carcase. Let us\n      be off—let us take our departure!—for we shall find our\n      delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to\n      commence in celebration of the king’s escape! Listen! it has already\n      commenced. See!—the whole town is topsy-turvy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Surely this is the most populous city of the East! What a wilderness of\n      people! what a jumble of all ranks and ages! what a multiplicity of sects\n      and nations! what a variety of costumes! what a Babel of languages! what a\n      screaming of beasts! what a tinkling of instruments! what a parcel of\n      philosophers!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Come let us be off.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Stay a moment! I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is the meaning\n      of it, I beseech you?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      That?—oh, nothing! The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne being,\n      as they declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor, wisdom, and divinity\n      of their king, and having, moreover, been eye-witnesses of his late\n      superhuman agility, do think it no more than their duty to invest his\n      brows (in addition to the poetic crown) with the wreath of victory in the\n      footrace—a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the\n      celebration of the next Olympiad, and which, therefore, they now give him\n      in advance.\n    </p>\n<h3>Footnotes—Four Beasts</h3>\n<p>\n      (*1) Flavius Vospicus says, that the hymn here introduced was sung by the\n      rabble upon the occasion of Aurelian, in the Sarmatic war, having slain,\n      with his own hand, nine hundred and fifty of the enemy.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap07\"></a>THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n  What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid\n  himself among women, although puzzling questions, are not beyond\n  <i>all</i> conjecture.\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n—<i>Sir Thomas Browne.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves,\n      but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their\n      effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to\n      their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest\n      enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in\n      such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in\n      that moral activity which <i>disentangles.</i> He derives pleasure from\n      even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is\n      fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his\n      solutions of each a degree of <i>acumen</i> which appears to the ordinary\n      apprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the very\n      soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical\n      study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and\n      merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if\n      <i>par excellence</i>, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to\n      analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the\n      other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental\n      character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but\n      simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much\n      at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher\n      powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully\n      tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate\n      frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and\n      <i>bizarre</i> motions, with various and variable values, what is only\n      complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The\n      <i>attention</i> is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an\n      instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The\n      possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such\n      oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more\n      concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In\n      draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are <i>unique</i> and have but\n      little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and\n      the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages\n      are obtained by either party are obtained by superior <i>acumen</i>. To\n      be less abstract, let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are\n      reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be\n      expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players\n      being at all equal) only by some <i>recherché</i> movement, the result of\n      some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources,\n      the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies\n      himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole\n      methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce\n      into error or hurry into miscalculation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the\n      calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been\n      known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing\n      chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so\n      greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in\n      Christendom <i>may</i> be little more than the best player of chess; but\n      proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more\n      important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say\n      proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a\n      comprehension of <i>all</i> the sources whence legitimate advantage may be\n      derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently\n      among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary\n      understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so\n      far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the\n      rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are\n      sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive\n      memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly regarded as the\n      sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere\n      rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a\n      host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and\n      the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much\n      in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The\n      necessary knowledge is that of <i>what</i> to observe. Our player confines\n      himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject\n      deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance\n      of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents.\n      He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting\n      trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their\n      holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play\n      progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the\n      expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin. From the\n      manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can\n      make another in the suit. He recognises what is played through feint, by\n      the manner with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent\n      word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying\n      anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the\n      tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation,\n      eagerness or trepidation—all afford, to his apparently intuitive\n      perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two or\n      three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents\n      of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a\n      precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the\n      faces of their own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity; for\n      while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often\n      remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power, by\n      which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I\n      believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a\n      primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect\n      bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation\n      among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there\n      exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and\n      the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be\n      found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the <i>truly</i>\n      imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the\n      light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18—, I\n      there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young\n      gentleman was of an excellent, indeed of an illustrious family, but,\n      by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the\n      energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir\n      himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By\n      courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small\n      remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he\n      managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of\n      life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed,\n      were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where\n      the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very\n      remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other\n      again and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history\n      which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges\n      whenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent\n      of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the\n      wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination. Seeking in Paris\n      the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be\n      to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him.\n      It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in\n      the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed\n      than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and\n      furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our\n      common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through\n      superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in\n      a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we\n      should have been regarded as madmen—although, perhaps, as madmen of\n      a harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors.\n      Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret\n      from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had\n      ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to\n      be enamored of the night for her own sake; and into this <i>bizarrerie</i>,\n      as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims\n      with a perfect <i>abandon</i>. The sable divinity would not herself dwell\n      with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn\n      of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building;\n      lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the\n      ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our\n      souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the\n      clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the\n      streets arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and\n      wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the\n      populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation\n      can afford.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his\n      rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic\n      ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise—if\n      not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to confess the\n      pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that\n      most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was\n      wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of\n      his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid\n      and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually\n      a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but\n      for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation.\n      Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old\n      philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a\n      double Dupin—the creative and the resolvent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing\n      any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the\n      Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased\n      intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in\n      question an example will best convey the idea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of\n      the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither\n      of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once\n      Dupin broke forth with these words:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better\n      for the <i>Théâtre des Variétés</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first\n      observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary\n      manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an\n      instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not\n      hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How\n      was it possible you should know I was thinking of ——?” Here I\n      paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I\n      thought.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “—— of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you\n      pause? You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted\n      him for tragedy.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.\n      Chantilly was a <i>quondam</i> cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming\n      stage-mad, had attempted the <i>rôle</i> of Xerxes, in Crébillon’s\n      tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if method\n      there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this\n      matter.” In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing\n      to express.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the\n      conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for\n      Xerxes <i>et id genus omne</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer\n      whomsoever.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may have\n      been fifteen minutes ago.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a\n      large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we\n      passed from the Rue C—— into the thoroughfare where we stood;\n      but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was not a particle of <i>charlatânerie</i> about Dupin. “I\n      will explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will\n      first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I\n      spoke to you until that of the <i>rencontre</i> with the fruiterer in\n      question. The larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion,\n      Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused\n      themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their\n      own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and\n      he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently\n      illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the\n      goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman\n      speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging\n      that he had spoken the truth. He continued:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving\n      the Rue C——. This was the last subject we discussed. As we\n      crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head,\n      brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving stones\n      collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped\n      upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle,\n      appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile,\n      and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what\n      you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of\n      necessity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant\n      expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were\n      still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called\n      Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the\n      overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and,\n      perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word\n      ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement.\n      I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being\n      brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and\n      since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to\n      you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that\n      noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I\n      felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great <i>nebula</i>\n      in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up;\n      and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in\n      that bitter <i>tirade</i> upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday’s ‘<i>Musée</i>,’\n      the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler’s change of\n      name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have\n      often conversed. I mean the line\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.\n</p>\n<p>\n      “I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written\n      Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was\n      aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that\n      you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That\n      you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over\n      your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation. So far, you had\n      been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your\n      full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure\n      of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that\n      as, in fact, he was a very little fellow—that Chantilly—he\n      would do better at the <i>Théâtre des Variétés</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the\n      “Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our\n      attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Extraordinary Murders</i>.—This morning, about three o’clock, the\n      inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a\n      succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story\n      of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one\n      Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye. After\n      some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the\n      usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten\n      of the neighbors entered accompanied by two <i>gendarmes</i>. By this time\n      the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of\n      stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished\n      and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second\n      landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased and everything\n      remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves and hurried from\n      room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story,\n      (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced\n      open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not\n      less with horror than with astonishment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture broken and\n      thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this\n      the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a\n      chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three\n      long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and\n      seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found\n      four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three\n      smaller of <i>métal d’Alger</i>, and two bags, containing nearly\n      four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a <i>bureau</i>, which stood\n      in one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many\n      articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under\n      the <i>bed</i> (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still\n      in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers\n      of little consequence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of\n      soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney,\n      and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was\n      dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a\n      considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many\n      excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with\n      which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe\n      scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of\n      finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without\n      farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the\n      rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her\n      throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell\n      off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated—the\n      former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest\n      clew.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The next day’s paper had these additional particulars.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue.</i>—Many individuals have been examined\n      in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair” [The word\n      ‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys\n      with us], “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it. We\n      give below all the material testimony elicited.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Pauline Dubourg</i>, laundress, deposes that she has known both the\n      deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The\n      old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms—very affectionate\n      towards each other. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to\n      their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a\n      living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons in the\n      house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that\n      they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any\n      part of the building except in the fourth story.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Pierre Moreau</i>, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit\n      of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for\n      nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided\n      there. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the\n      corpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a\n      jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house was\n      the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the\n      premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any\n      portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter some\n      five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly\n      retired life—were reputed to have money. Had heard it said among the\n      neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not believe it. Had never\n      seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a\n      porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one\n      was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there\n      were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters of\n      the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always\n      closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The house\n      was a good house—not very old.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Isidore Musèt</i>, <i>gendarme</i>, deposes that he was called to the\n      house about three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty\n      persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at\n      length, with a bayonet—not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty\n      in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and\n      bolted neither at bottom not top. The shrieks were continued until the\n      gate was forced—and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams\n      of some person (or persons) in great agony—were loud and drawn out,\n      not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the\n      first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one\n      a gruff voice, the other much shriller—a very strange voice. Could\n      distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was\n      positive that it was not a woman’s voice. Could distinguish the words ‘<i>sacré</i>’\n      and ‘<i>diable.</i>’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not\n      be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make\n      out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of\n      the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described\n      them yesterday.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Henri Duval</i>, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that\n      he was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the\n      testimony of Musèt in general. As soon as they forced an entrance,\n      they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast,\n      notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this witness\n      thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not\n      be sure that it was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not\n      acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words, but\n      was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew\n      Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure\n      that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “——<i>Odenheimer, restaurateur.</i> This witness volunteered his\n      testimony. Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a\n      native of Amsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks.\n      They lasted for several minutes—probably ten. They were long and\n      loud—very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered the\n      building. Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was\n      sure that the shrill voice was that of a man—of a Frenchman. Could\n      not distinguish the words uttered. They were loud and quick—unequal—spoken\n      apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh—not so\n      much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice\n      said repeatedly ‘<i>sacré</i>,’ ‘<i>diable</i>,’ and once ‘<i>mon\n      Dieu.</i>’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Jules Mignaud</i>, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue\n      Deloraine. Is the elder Mignaud. Madame L’Espanaye had some property. Had\n      opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year—(eight\n      years previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for\n      nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person\n      the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home\n      with the money.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Adolphe Le Bon</i>, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day\n      in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence\n      with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened,\n      Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while\n      the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did\n      not see any person in the street at the time. It is a by-street—very\n      lonely.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>William Bird</i>, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who\n      entered the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one\n      of the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The\n      gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but\n      cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly ‘<i>sacré</i>’ and ‘<i>mon\n      Dieu.</i>’ There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons\n      struggling—a scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very\n      loud—louder than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of\n      an Englishman. Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman’s\n      voice. Does not understand German.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door\n      of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked\n      on the inside when the party reached it. Every thing was perfectly silent—no\n      groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door no person was seen.\n      The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly\n      fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed, but not\n      locked. The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked,\n      with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of the house, on the\n      fourth story, at the head of the passage was open, the door being ajar.\n      This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth. These were\n      carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch of any portion of\n      the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down\n      the chimneys. The house was a four story one, with garrets (<i>mansardes.</i>)\n      A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely—did not appear\n      to have been opened for years. The time elapsing between the hearing of\n      the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door, was\n      variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as short as three minutes—some\n      as long as five. The door was opened with difficulty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Alfonzo Garcio</i>, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue\n      Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house.\n      Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the\n      consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice\n      was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill\n      voice was that of an Englishman—is sure of this. Does not understand\n      the English language, but judges by the intonation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Alberto Montani</i>, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first\n      to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was\n      that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to\n      be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke\n      quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the\n      general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the\n      rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human\n      being. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes, such as are\n      employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed up and\n      down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one\n      could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of\n      Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could\n      not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Paul Dumas</i>, physician, deposes that he was called to view the\n      bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the\n      bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the\n      young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been\n      thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances.\n      The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just\n      below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently\n      the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the\n      eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large\n      bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently,\n      by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle\n      L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown.\n      The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the\n      right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left <i>tibia</i> much\n      splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side. Whole body\n      dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how the\n      injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron—a\n      chair—any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such\n      results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could\n      have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of the deceased, when\n      seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also\n      greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp\n      instrument—probably with a razor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Alexandre Etienne</i>, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the\n      bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other\n      persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all\n      its particulars, was never before committed in Paris—if indeed a\n      murder has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault—an\n      unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the\n      shadow of a clew apparent.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still\n      continued in the Quartier St. Roch—that the premises in question had\n      been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses\n      instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned that\n      Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned—although nothing\n      appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair—at\n      least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only\n      after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me\n      my opinion respecting the murders.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble\n      mystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the\n      murderer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an\n      examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for <i>acumen</i>, are\n      cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the\n      method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not\n      unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put\n      us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain’s calling for his <i>robe-de-chambre—pour\n      mieux entendre la musique.</i> The results attained by them are not\n      unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by\n      simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their\n      schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser and a persevering\n      man. But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very\n      intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the\n      object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual\n      clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a\n      whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not\n      always in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do\n      believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys\n      where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found. The\n      modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the\n      contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances—to\n      view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of\n      the <i>retina</i> (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than\n      the interior), is to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best\n      appreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in\n      proportion as we turn our vision <i>fully</i> upon it. A greater number of\n      rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former,\n      there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity\n      we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus\n      herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too\n      concentrated, or too direct.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves,\n      before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us\n      amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing]\n      “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not\n      ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know G——,\n      the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the\n      necessary permission.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue.\n      This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the\n      Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we\n      reached it, as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we\n      resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons\n      gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the\n      opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a\n      gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel\n      in the window, indicating a <i>loge de concierge.</i> Before going in we\n      walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning,\n      passed in the rear of the building—Dupin, meanwhile examining the\n      whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention\n      for which I could see no possible object.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang,\n      and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge.\n      We went up stairs—into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle\n      L’Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The\n      disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing\n      beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.” Dupin\n      scrutinized every thing—not excepting the bodies of the victims. We\n      then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a <i>gendarme</i>\n      accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when\n      we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped in for a\n      moment at the office of one of the daily papers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that <i>Je les\n      ménageais</i>:—for this phrase there is no English equivalent.\n      It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the\n      murder, until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I\n      had observed any thing <i>peculiar</i> at the scene of the atrocity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,”\n       which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No, nothing <i>peculiar</i>,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we\n      both saw stated in the paper.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual\n      horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It\n      appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very\n      reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution—I\n      mean for the <i>outré</i> character of its features. The police are\n      confounded by the seeming absence of motive—not for the murder\n      itself—but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by\n      the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention,\n      with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated\n      Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without\n      the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the\n      corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful\n      mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those\n      just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to\n      paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted <i>acumen</i>,\n      of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error\n      of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these\n      deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if\n      at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we are now\n      pursuing, it should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has\n      occurred that has never occurred before.’ In fact, the facility with which\n      I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in\n      the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our\n      apartment—“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the\n      perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated\n      in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is\n      probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in this supposition;\n      for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look\n      for the man here—in this room—every moment. It is true that he\n      may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he come, it\n      will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both know how to\n      use them when occasion demands their use.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I\n      heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have already\n      spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was addressed\n      to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation\n      which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance.\n      His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the\n      stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by\n      the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the\n      old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have\n      committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method;\n      for the strength of Madame L’Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to\n      the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it was\n      found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude\n      the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed by some\n      third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in\n      contention. Let me now advert—not to the whole testimony respecting\n      these voices—but to what was <i>peculiar</i> in that testimony. Did\n      you observe any thing peculiar about it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff\n      voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to\n      the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the\n      peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet\n      there <i>was</i> something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark,\n      agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to\n      the shrill voice, the peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but\n      that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a\n      Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that <i>of a\n      foreigner</i>. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own\n      countrymen. Each likens it—not to the voice of an individual of any\n      nation with whose language he is conversant—but the converse. The\n      Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have\n      distinguished some words <i>had he been acquainted with the Spanish.</i>’\n      The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it\n      stated that ‘<i>not understanding French this witness was examined through\n      an interpreter.</i>’ The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and ‘<i>does\n      not understand German.</i>’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that of an\n      Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘<i>as he has no\n      knowledge of the English.</i>’ The Italian believes it the voice of a\n      Russian, but ‘<i>has never conversed with a native of Russia.</i>’ A\n      second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that\n      the voice was that of an Italian; but, <i>not being cognizant of that\n      tongue</i>, is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how\n      strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such\n      testimony as this <i>could</i> have been elicited!—in whose <i>tones</i>,\n      even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise\n      nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an\n      Asiatic—of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in\n      Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your\n      attention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh\n      rather than shrill.’ It is represented by two others to have been ‘quick\n      and <i>unequal.</i>’ No words—no sounds resembling words—were\n      by any witness mentioned as distinguishable.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made, so far,\n      upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate\n      deductions even from this portion of the testimony—the portion\n      respecting the gruff and shrill voices—are in themselves sufficient\n      to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther\n      progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said ‘legitimate\n      deductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to\n      imply that the deductions are the <i>sole</i> proper ones, and that the\n      suspicion arises <i>inevitably</i> from them as the single result. What\n      the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to\n      bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a\n      definite form—a certain tendency—to my inquiries in the\n      chamber.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we\n      first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is not\n      too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events.\n      Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The\n      doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how?\n      Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that\n      mode <i>must</i> lead us to a definite decision. Let us examine,\n      each by each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins\n      were in the room where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in\n      the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only\n      from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have\n      laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every\n      direction. No <i>secret</i> issues could have escaped their vigilance.\n      But, not trusting to <i>their</i> eyes, I examined with my own. There\n      were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the\n      passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the\n      chimneys. These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet\n      above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a\n      large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being\n      thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front\n      room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the\n      street. The murderers <i>must</i> have passed, then, through those of the\n      back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as\n      we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of\n      apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these\n      apparent ‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by\n      furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden\n      from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up\n      against it. The former was found securely fastened from within. It\n      resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large\n      gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout\n      nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the\n      other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a\n      vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now\n      entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And, <i>therefore</i>,\n      it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open\n      the windows.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the\n      reason I have just given—because here it was, I knew, that all\n      apparent impossibilities <i>must</i> be proved to be not such in reality.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I proceeded to think thus—<i>a posteriori</i>. The murderers\n      did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have\n      refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened;—the\n      consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny\n      of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes <i>were</i> fastened. They\n      <i>must</i>, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no\n      escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement,\n      withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash. It\n      resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I\n      now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my\n      premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the\n      circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light\n      the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery,\n      forbore to upraise the sash.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out\n      through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have\n      caught—but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion was\n      plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The assassins\n      <i>must</i> have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then, the\n      springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there <i>must</i>\n      be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of\n      their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the\n      head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind\n      the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I\n      had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked at\n      the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same\n      manner—driven in nearly up to the head.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have\n      misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I\n      had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant been\n      lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret\n      to its ultimate result,—and that result was <i>the nail.</i> It had,\n      I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window;\n      but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might seem to be)\n      when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated\n      the clew. ‘There <i>must</i> be something wrong,’ I said, ‘about the\n      nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the\n      shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the\n      gimlet-hole where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for\n      its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished\n      by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the\n      bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this\n      head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance\n      to a perfect nail was complete—the fissure was invisible. Pressing\n      the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up\n      with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance\n      of the whole nail was again perfect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through\n      the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his\n      exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring;\n      and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the\n      police for that of the nail,—farther inquiry being thus considered\n      unnecessary.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had\n      been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet\n      and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From\n      this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window\n      itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the\n      shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian\n      carpenters <i>ferrades</i>—a kind rarely employed at the present\n      day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux.\n      They are in the form of an ordinary door (a single, not a folding door),\n      except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis—thus\n      affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these\n      shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the\n      rear of the house, they were both about half open—that is to say,\n      they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the\n      police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so,\n      in looking at these <i>ferrades</i> in the line of their breadth (as they\n      must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at\n      all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once\n      satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter,\n      they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear\n      to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of\n      the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet\n      of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very\n      unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from\n      the rod, might have been thus effected. By reaching to the distance\n      of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole\n      extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work.\n      Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against\n      the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so\n      as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even\n      have swung himself into the room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a <i>very</i>\n      unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so\n      difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might\n      possibly have been accomplished:—but, secondly and <i>chiefly</i>, I\n      wish to impress upon your understanding the <i>very extraordinary</i>—the\n      almost præternatural character of that agility which could have\n      accomplished it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make out\n      my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation\n      of the activity required in this matter. This may be the practice in law,\n      but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only the truth.\n      My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition, that <i>very\n      unusual</i> activity of which I have just spoken with that <i>very\n      peculiar</i> shrill (or harsh) and <i>unequal</i> voice, about whose\n      nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance\n      no syllabification could be detected.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin\n      flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension\n      without power to comprehend—as men, at times, find themselves upon the\n      brink of remembrance without being able, in the end, to remember. My\n      friend went on with his discourse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode\n      of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that\n      both were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now\n      revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here.\n      The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many\n      articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is\n      absurd. It is a mere guess—a very silly one—and no more. How\n      are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these\n      drawers had originally contained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter lived\n      an exceedingly retired life—saw no company—seldom went out—had\n      little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least\n      of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a\n      thief had taken any, why did he not take the best—why did he not\n      take all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to\n      encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold <i>was</i> abandoned.\n      Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was\n      discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard\n      from your thoughts the blundering idea of <i>motive</i>, engendered in the\n      brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money\n      delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as remarkable\n      as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days\n      upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives,\n      without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are\n      great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been\n      educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities—that theory\n      to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the\n      most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been\n      gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed\n      something more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative of\n      this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we\n      are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the\n      perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his\n      motive together.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your\n      attention—that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that\n      startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this—let\n      us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by\n      manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary\n      assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they\n      thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the\n      chimney, you will admit that there was something <i>excessively outré</i>—something\n      altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even\n      when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great\n      must have been that strength which could have thrust the body <i>up</i>\n      such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was\n      found barely sufficient to drag it <i>down!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      “Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most\n      marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick tresses—of\n      grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of\n      the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or\n      thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself.\n      Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of\n      the scalp—sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted\n      in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the\n      old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the\n      body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the <i>brutal</i>\n      ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L’Espanaye\n      I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne,\n      have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so\n      far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly\n      the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the\n      window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now\n      seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the\n      shutters escaped them—because, by the affair of the nails, their\n      perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the\n      windows having ever been opened at all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon\n      the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the\n      ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal,\n      a butchery without motive, a <i>grotesquerie</i> in horror absolutely\n      alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of\n      many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification.\n      What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your\n      fancy?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question. “A madman,”\n       I said, “has done this deed—some raving maniac, escaped from a\n      neighboring <i>Maison de Santé.</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But the\n      voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to\n      tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some\n      nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always\n      the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not\n      such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the\n      rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L’Espanaye. Tell me what you can make\n      of it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual—this\n      is no <i>human</i> hair.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide this\n      point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon\n      this paper. It is a <i>fac-simile</i> drawing of what has been described\n      in one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations of\n      finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in another\n      (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots, evidently the\n      impression of fingers.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the\n      table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed\n      hold. There is no <i>slipping</i> apparent. Each finger has retained—possibly\n      until the death of the victim—the fearful grasp by which it\n      originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at\n      the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I made the attempt in vain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said. “The paper\n      is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical.\n      Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the\n      throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. “This,” I\n      said, “is the mark of no human hand.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large\n      fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature,\n      the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative\n      propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. I\n      understood the full horrors of the murder at once.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading, “is\n      in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but an\n      Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the\n      indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is\n      identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot\n      possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides,\n      there were <i>two</i> voices heard in contention, and one of them was\n      unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously,\n      by the evidence, to this voice,—the expression, ‘<i>mon Dieu!</i>’\n      This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the\n      witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or\n      expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my\n      hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the\n      murder. It is possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that\n      he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took\n      place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it\n      to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he\n      could never have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue\n      these guesses—for I have no right to call them more—since the\n      shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient\n      depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend\n      to make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call\n      them guesses then, and speak of them as such. If the Frenchman in question\n      is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement\n      which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of ‘Le\n      Monde’ (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by\n      sailors), will bring him to our residence.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He handed me a paper, and I read thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n      C<small>AUGHT</small>—<i>In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the ——inst.,</i>\n      (the morning of the murder),owner <i>a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the\n      Bornese species. The owner (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging\n      to a Maltese vessel) may have the animal again, upon identifying it\n      satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and\n      keeping. Call at No. ——, Rue ——, Faubourg St.\n      Germain—au troisième.</i>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n      “How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a\n      sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I do <i>not</i> know it,” said Dupin. “I am not <i>sure</i> of it. Here,\n      however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its\n      greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of\n      those long <i>queues</i> of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot\n      is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese.\n      I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have\n      belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my\n      induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a\n      Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the\n      advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been\n      misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to\n      inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although\n      innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about\n      replying to the advertisement—about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He\n      will reason thus:—‘I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of\n      great value—to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself—why\n      should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within\n      my grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne—at a vast distance\n      from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute\n      beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault—they have\n      failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal,\n      it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to\n      implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, <i>I am\n      known.</i> The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I\n      am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid\n      claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I\n      will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy\n      to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the\n      advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter\n      has blown over.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor show\n      them until at a signal from myself.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had\n      entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase.\n      Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending.\n      Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up.\n      He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and\n      rapped at the door of our chamber.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A man entered. He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and\n      muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of\n      countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt,\n      was more than half hidden by whisker and <i>mustachio.</i> He had with him\n      a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed\n      awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which, although\n      somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian\n      origin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin. “I suppose you have called about the\n      Ourang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a\n      remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you\n      suppose him to be?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some\n      intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have no way of telling—but he can’t be more than four or five\n      years old. Have you got him here?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery\n      stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of\n      course you are prepared to identify the property?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure I am, sir.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,”\n       said the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for the\n      finding of the animal—that is to say, any thing in reason.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me\n      think!—what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be\n      this. You shall give me all the information in your power about these\n      murders in the Rue Morgue.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as\n      quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in his\n      pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the\n      least flurry, upon the table.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation. He\n      started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he fell\n      back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death\n      itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself\n      unnecessarily—you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge\n      you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no\n      injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in\n      the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some\n      measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know\n      that I have had means of information about this matter—means of\n      which you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have\n      done nothing which you could have avoided—nothing, certainly, which\n      renders you culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might\n      have robbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason\n      for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of\n      honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged\n      with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while\n      Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all\n      gone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “So help me God!” said he, after a brief pause, “I <i>will</i> tell you all I\n      know about this affair;—but I do not expect you to believe one half\n      I say—I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I <i>am</i> innocent, and I\n      will make a clean breast if I die for it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the\n      Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and\n      passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a\n      companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This companion dying, the animal\n      fell into his own exclusive possession. After great trouble, occasioned by\n      the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at\n      length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris,\n      where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his\n      neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should\n      recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship.\n      His ultimate design was to sell it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Returning home from some sailors’ frolic the night, or rather in the\n      morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into\n      which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was\n      thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was\n      sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in\n      which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole\n      of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the\n      possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man,\n      for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed,\n      however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of\n      a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang\n      sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and\n      thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand,\n      occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until\n      the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this\n      manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly\n      quiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing down an\n      alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was arrested\n      by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s chamber,\n      in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived\n      the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the\n      shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means,\n      swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The whole feat did\n      not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by the\n      Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had\n      strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape\n      from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it\n      might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much\n      cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter\n      reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod is\n      ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had\n      arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was\n      stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to\n      obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly\n      fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those hideous\n      shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates\n      of the Rue Morgue. Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their\n      night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in\n      the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle\n      of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The\n      victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and,\n      from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams,\n      it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to\n      of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L’Espanaye\n      by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was\n      flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a\n      barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The\n      screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from\n      her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the\n      Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of its\n      muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood\n      inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire\n      from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful\n      talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering\n      and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which\n      the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible. The fury\n      of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was\n      instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it\n      seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the\n      chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the\n      furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In\n      conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up\n      the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it\n      immediately hurled through the window headlong.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor\n      shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it,\n      hurried at once home—dreading the consequences of the butchery, and\n      gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the\n      Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the\n      Frenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the\n      fiendish jabberings of the brute.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from\n      the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It must have\n      closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by\n      the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the <i>Jardin\n      des Plantes.</i> Le Don was instantly released, upon our narration of the\n      circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect\n      of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not\n      altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and\n      was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every\n      person minding his own business.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let him talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply.\n      “Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am satisfied with\n      having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in the\n      solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he\n      supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning\n      to be profound. In his wisdom is no <i>stamen.</i> It is all head and no\n      body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,—or, at best, all\n      head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all. I\n      like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has\n      attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has ‘<i>de nier\n      ce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas.</i>’” (*)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*) Rousseau—Nouvelle Heloïse.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap08\"></a>THE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET.(*1)</h2>\n<h3>\n      A SEQUEL TO “THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.”\n     </h3>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n  Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten, die der Wirklichkeit\n  parallel lauft. Selten fallen sie zusammen. Menschen und zufalle\n  modificiren gewohulich die idealische Begebenheit, so dass sie\n  unvollkommen erscheint, und ihre Folgen gleichfalls unvollkommen\n  sind. So bei der Reformation; statt des Protestantismus kam das\n  Lutherthum hervor.<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real\n  ones. They rarely coincide. Men and circumstances generally modify\n  the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and its\n  consequences are equally imperfect. Thus with the Reformation;\n  instead of Protestantism came Lutheranism.—<i>Novalis</i>.(*2) <i>Moral Ansichten</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not\n      occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the\n      supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that,\n      as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. Such\n      sentiments—for the half-credences of which I speak have never the\n      full force of thought—such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled\n      unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically\n      termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is, in its\n      essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most\n      rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the\n      most intangible in speculation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make public, will\n      be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the primary branch of a\n      series of scarcely intelligible coincidences, whose secondary or\n      concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder of\n      Mary Cecila Rogers, at New York.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When, in an article entitled “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” I\n      endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features in\n      the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, it did\n      not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject. This depicting of\n      character constituted my design; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled\n      in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance Dupin’s\n      idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples, but I should have\n      proven no more. Late events, however, in their surprising development,\n      have startled me into some farther details, which will carry with them the\n      air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have lately heard, it would be\n      indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to what I both heard and\n      saw so long ago.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame\n      L’Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once\n      from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie.\n      Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor;\n      and, continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we\n      gave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present,\n      weaving the dull world around us into dreams.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted. It may readily be\n      supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the Rue\n      Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the Parisian\n      police. With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into a household\n      word. The simple character of those inductions by which he had\n      disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the Prefect,\n      or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not surprising\n      that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the\n      Chevalier’s analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition.\n      His frankness would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such\n      prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all farther agitation of a topic\n      whose interest to himself had long ceased. It thus happened that he found\n      himself the cynosure of the political eyes; and the cases were not few in\n      which attempt was made to engage his services at the Prefecture. One of\n      the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named\n      Marie Rogêt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue Morgue.\n      Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest attention from\n      their resemblance to those of the unfortunate “cigar girl,” was the only\n      daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt. The father had died during the\n      child’s infancy, and from the period of his death, until within eighteen\n      months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative,\n      the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the Rue Pavée Saint\n      Andrée; (*3) Madame there keeping a pension, assisted by Marie.\n      Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year,\n      when her great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one\n      of the shops in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom lay\n      chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood.\n      Monsieur Le Blanc (*4) was not unaware of the advantages to be derived\n      from the attendance of the fair Marie in his perfumery; and his liberal\n      proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, although with somewhat more\n      of hesitation by Madame.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon\n      became notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette. She had\n      been in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown info\n      confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop. Monsieur Le Blanc was\n      unable to account for her absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted\n      with anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately took up the theme,\n      and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations, when,\n      one fine morning, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health, but\n      with a somewhat saddened air, made her re-appearance at her usual counter\n      in the perfumery. All inquiry, except that of a private character, was of\n      course immediately hushed. Monsieur Le Blanc professed total ignorance, as\n      before. Marie, with Madame, replied to all questions, that the last week\n      had been spent at the house of a relation in the country. Thus the affair\n      died away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to\n      relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final\n      adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother’s residence in\n      the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was about five months after this return home, that her friends were\n      alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time. Three days\n      elapsed, and nothing was heard of her. On the fourth her corpse was found\n      floating in the Seine, * near the shore which is opposite the Quartier of\n      the Rue Saint Andrée, and at a point not very far distant from the\n      secluded neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule. (*6)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that murder had\n      been committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all, her\n      previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds\n      of the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no similar occurrence\n      producing so general and so intense an effect. For several weeks, in the\n      discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political\n      topics of the day were forgotten. The Prefect made unusual exertions; and\n      the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to the\n      utmost extent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the\n      murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period, the\n      inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the\n      expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and\n      even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the mean time\n      the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and\n      numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the\n      continual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement\n      greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to\n      double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having\n      elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always\n      exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several\n      serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum\n      of twenty thousand francs “for the conviction of the assassin,” or, if\n      more than one should prove to have been implicated, “for the conviction of\n      any one of the assassins.” In the proclamation setting forth this reward,\n      a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in\n      evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it\n      appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten\n      thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. The\n      entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which\n      will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble\n      condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such\n      atrocities as the one described.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately\n      brought to light. But although, in one or two instances, arrests were made\n      which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could implicate\n      the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith. Strange as it\n      may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and\n      passed without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a\n      rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind, reached the\n      ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which absorbed our whole\n      attention, it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad,\n      or received a visitor, or more than glanced at the leading political\n      articles in one of the daily papers. The first intelligence of the murder\n      was brought us by G——, in person. He called upon us early in\n      the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18—, and remained with us\n      until late in the night. He had been piqued by the failure of all his\n      endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His reputation—so he said\n      with a peculiarly Parisian air—was at stake. Even his honor was\n      concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was really no\n      sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the\n      mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what\n      he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin, and made him a direct, and\n      certainly a liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel\n      myself at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper\n      subject of my narrative.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition he\n      accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether provisional.\n      This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into\n      explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon\n      the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession. He discoursed\n      much, and beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional\n      suggestion as the night wore drowsily away. Dupin, sitting steadily in his\n      accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment of respectful attention. He wore\n      spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional signal glance\n      beneath their green glasses, sufficed to convince me that he slept not the\n      less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight\n      leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure of the\n      Prefect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all the\n      evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy of every\n      paper in which, from first to last, had been published any decisive\n      information in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all that was\n      positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée\n      St. Andrée, about nine o’clock in the morning of Sunday, June the\n      twenty-second, 18—. In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur\n      Jacques St. Eustache, (*7) and to him only, of her intent intention to\n      spend the day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The\n      Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not\n      far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in\n      the most direct course possible, from the pension of Madame Rogêt.\n      St. Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took\n      his meals, at the pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk,\n      and to have escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to\n      rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her\n      aunt’s, (as she had done under similar circumstances before,) he did not\n      think it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, Madame Rogêt\n      (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express a\n      fear “that she should never see Marie again;” but this observation\n      attracted little attention at the time.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des Drômes;\n      and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search was\n      instituted at several points in the city, and its environs. It was not,\n      however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that any\n      thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day,\n      (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a Monsieur Beauvais, (*8) who, with\n      a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barrière du\n      Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée\n      St. Andrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore\n      by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the\n      body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the\n      perfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more promptly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the\n      mouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was\n      no discoloration in the cellular tissue. About the throat were bruises and\n      impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over on the chest and were\n      rigid. The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. On the left\n      wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or\n      of a rope in more than one volution. A part of the right wrist, also, was\n      much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more\n      especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to the shore the\n      fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the excoriations had been\n      effected by this. The flesh of the neck was much swollen. There were no\n      cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of blows. A piece of\n      lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight;\n      it was completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay\n      just under the left ear. This alone would have sufficed to produce death.\n      The medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the\n      deceased. She had been subjected, it said, to brutal violence. The corpse\n      was in such condition when found, that there could have been no difficulty\n      in its recognition by friends.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer garment, a\n      slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the\n      waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist, and\n      secured by a sort of hitch in the back. The dress immediately beneath the\n      frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had\n      been torn entirely out—torn very evenly and with great care. It was\n      found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot. Over\n      this muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a bonnet were\n      attached; the bonnet being appended. The knot by which the strings of the\n      bonnet were fastened, was not a lady’s, but a slip or sailor’s knot.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the\n      Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily interred not far\n      from the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of\n      Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and\n      several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted. A weekly\n      paper, (*9) however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was\n      disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited\n      beyond what has been already noted. The clothes, however, were now\n      submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified\n      as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were\n      arrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion; and\n      he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts\n      during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subsequently, however, he\n      submitted to Monsieur G——, affidavits, accounting\n      satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed and\n      no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated, and\n      journalists busied themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one which\n      attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Rogêt still\n      lived—that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other\n      unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages\n      which embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal\n      translations from L’Etoile, (*10) a paper conducted, in general, with much\n      ability.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother’s house on Sunday morning, June\n      the twenty-second, 18—, with the ostensible purpose of going to see\n      her aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes. From that\n      hour, nobody is proved to have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of\n      her at all.... There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who\n      saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother’s door.... Now,\n      though we have no evidence that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the\n      living after nine o’clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof\n      that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a\n      female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière de\n      Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown\n      into the river within three hours after she left her mother’s house, only\n      three days from the time she left her home—three days to an hour.\n      But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on her\n      body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her\n      murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who are\n      guilty of such horrid crimes choose darkness rather the light.... Thus we\n      see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Rogêt, it\n      could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at the\n      outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown\n      into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to\n      ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the\n      water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at\n      least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again, if let alone. Now, we\n      ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary\n      course of nature?... If the body had been kept in its mangled state on\n      shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the\n      murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon\n      afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days. And,\n      furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had\n      committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in\n      without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily\n      been taken.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the\n      water “not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,”\n       because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty in\n      recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully disproved. I\n      continue the translation:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no doubt\n      the body was that of Marie Rogêt? He ripped up the gown sleeve, and\n      says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public\n      generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of\n      scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it—something as\n      indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined—as little\n      conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return\n      that night, but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o’clock, on\n      Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress respecting\n      her daughter. If we allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and\n      grief, could not go over, (which is allowing a great deal,) there\n      certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to\n      go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of\n      Marie. Nobody went over. There was nothing said or heard about the matter\n      in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the occupants\n      of the same building. M. St. Eustache, the lover and intended husband of\n      Marie, who boarded in her mother’s house, deposes that he did not hear of\n      the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning, when M.\n      Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news\n      like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy\n      on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition\n      that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations\n      amount to this: that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had\n      absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her\n      chastity; and that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in the\n      Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the\n      opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death. But\n      L’Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved that no apathy,\n      such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble,\n      and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty; that St. Eustache,\n      so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore\n      himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and\n      relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination\n      at the disinterment. Moreover, although it was stated by L’Etoile, that\n      the corpse was re-interred at the public expense—that an\n      advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely declined by the\n      family—and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial;—although,\n      I say, all this was asserted by L’Etoile in furtherance of the impression\n      it designed to convey—yet all this was satisfactorily disproved. In\n      a subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion\n      upon Beauvais himself. The editor says:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that on one\n      occasion, while a Madame B—— was at Madame Rogêt’s\n      house, M. Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a gendarme was\n      expected there, and she, Madame B., must not say anything to the gendarme\n      until he returned, but let the matter be for him.... In the present\n      posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up\n      in his head. A single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais, for, go\n      which way you will, you run against him.... For some reason, he determined\n      that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself,\n      and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their\n      representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very\n      much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown\n      upon Beauvais. A visitor at his office, a few days prior to the girl’s\n      disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a rose\n      in the key-hole of the door, and the name “Marie” inscribed upon a slate\n      which hung near at hand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the\n      newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang of\n      desperadoes—that by these she had been borne across the river,\n      maltreated and murdered. Le Commerciel, (*11) however, a print of\n      extensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea. I quote a\n      passage or two from its columns:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so far\n      as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule. It is impossible\n      that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should\n      have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one who\n      saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her. It\n      was when the streets were full of people, when she went out.... It is\n      impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or to\n      the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons;\n      yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother’s door, and\n      there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed\n      intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round\n      her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the murder\n      had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have been\n      no necessity for any such arrangement. The fact that the body was found\n      floating near the Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown\n      into the water..... A piece of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats,\n      two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin\n      around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by\n      fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important\n      information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the\n      chief portion of Le Commerciel’s argument. Two small boys, sons of a\n      Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du\n      Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or\n      four large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On\n      the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A\n      parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The\n      handkerchief bore the name “Marie Rogêt.” Fragments of dress were\n      discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were\n      broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the thicket\n      and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore\n      evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A weekly paper, Le Soleil,(*12) had the following comments upon this\n      discovery—comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole\n      Parisian press:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks;\n      they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain and stuck\n      together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them.\n      The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run\n      together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was\n      all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened..... The pieces of\n      her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six\n      inches long. One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended;\n      the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem. They looked like\n      strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the\n      ground..... There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this\n      appalling outrage has been discovered.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. Madame Deluc\n      testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the\n      river, opposite the Barrière du Roule. The neighborhood is secluded—particularly\n      so. It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards from the city, who cross\n      the river in boats. About three o’clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in\n      question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young man of\n      dark complexion. The two remained here for some time. On their departure,\n      they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity. Madame Deluc’s\n      attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, on account of its\n      resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative. A scarf was particularly\n      noticed. Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made\n      their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making\n      payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the\n      inn about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in great haste.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame Deluc, as well\n      as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the\n      inn. The screams were violent but brief. Madame D. recognized not only the\n      scarf which was found in the thicket, but the dress which was discovered\n      upon the corpse. An omnibus driver, Valence, (*13) now also testified that\n      he saw Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in\n      question, in company with a young man of dark complexion. He, Valence,\n      knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity. The articles found\n      in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of Marie.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself, from the\n      newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only one more point—but\n      this was a point of seemingly vast consequence. It appears that,\n      immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described, the\n      lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache, Marie’s betrothed, was\n      found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage. A\n      phial labelled “laudanum,” and emptied, was found near him. His breath\n      gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking. Upon his person was\n      found a letter, briefly stating his love for Marie, with his design of\n      self-destruction.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I need scarcely tell you,” said Dupin, as he finished the perusal of my\n      notes, “that this is a far more intricate case than that of the Rue\n      Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect. This is an\n      ordinary, although an atrocious instance of crime. There is nothing\n      peculiarly outré about it. You will observe that, for this reason,\n      the mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should\n      have been considered difficult, of solution. Thus; at first, it was\n      thought unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G——\n      were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have\n      been committed. They could picture to their imaginations a mode—many\n      modes—and a motive—many motives; and because it was not\n      impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been\n      the actual one, they have taken it for granted that one of them must. But\n      the case with which these variable fancies were entertained, and the very\n      plausibility which each assumed, should have been understood as indicative\n      rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend\n      elucidation. I have before observed that it is by prominences above the\n      plane of the ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search\n      for the true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not\n      so much ‘what has occurred?’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred\n      before?’ In the investigations at the house of Madame L’Espanaye, (*14)\n      the agents of G—— were discouraged and confounded by that very\n      unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded\n      the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been\n      plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in\n      the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but easy triumph\n      to the functionaries of the Prefecture.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In the case of Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter there was, even at the\n      beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder had been committed.\n      The idea of suicide was excluded at once. Here, too, we are freed, at the\n      commencement, from all supposition of self-murder. The body found at the\n      Barrière du Roule, was found under such circumstances as to leave\n      us no room for embarrassment upon this important point. But it has been\n      suggested that the corpse discovered, is not that of the Marie Rogêt\n      for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is offered,\n      and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been arranged with the\n      Prefect. We both know this gentleman well. It will not do to trust him too\n      far. If, dating our inquiries from the body found, and thence tracing a\n      murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual\n      than Marie; or, if starting from the living Marie, we find her, yet find\n      her unassassinated—in either case we lose our labor; since it is\n      Monsieur G—— with whom we have to deal. For our own purpose,\n      therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is indispensable that our\n      first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with\n      the Marie Rogêt who is missing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “With the public the arguments of L’Etoile have had weight; and that the\n      journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the\n      manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject—‘Several\n      of the morning papers of the day,’ it says, ‘speak of the <i>conclusive</i>\n      article in Monday’s Etoile.’ To me, this article appears conclusive of\n      little beyond the zeal of its inditer. We should bear in mind that, in\n      general, it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation—to\n      make a point—than to further the cause of truth. The latter end is\n      only pursued when it seems coincident with the former. The print which\n      merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however well founded this opinion\n      may be) earns for itself no credit with the mob. The mass of the people\n      regard as profound only him who suggests <i>pungent contradictions</i> of\n      the general idea. In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the\n      epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally\n      appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrame of\n      the idea, that Marie Rogêt still lives, rather than any true\n      plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to L’Etoile, and\n      secured it a favorable reception with the public. Let us examine the heads\n      of this journal’s argument; endeavoring to avoid the incoherence with\n      which it is originally set forth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the interval\n      between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse, that\n      this corpse cannot be that of Marie. The reduction of this interval to its\n      smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an object with the\n      reasoner. In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere\n      assumption at the outset. ‘It is folly to suppose,’ he says, ‘that the\n      murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated\n      soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river\n      before midnight.’ We demand at once, and very naturally, why? Why is it\n      folly to suppose that the murder was committed <i>within five minutes</i>\n      after the girl’s quitting her mother’s house? Why is it folly to suppose\n      that the murder was committed at any given period of the day? There have\n      been assassinations at all hours. But, had the murder taken place at any\n      moment between nine o’clock in the morning of Sunday, and a quarter before\n      midnight, there would still have been time enough ‘to throw the body into\n      the river before midnight.’ This assumption, then, amounts precisely to\n      this—that the murder was not committed on Sunday at all—and,\n      if we allow L’Etoile to assume this, we may permit it any liberties\n      whatever. The paragraph beginning ‘It is folly to suppose that the murder,\n      etc.,’ however it appears as printed in L’Etoile, may be imagined to have\n      existed actually thus in the brain of its inditer—‘It is folly to\n      suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the body, could have\n      been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body\n      into the river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose all this,\n      and to suppose at the same time, (as we are resolved to suppose,) that the\n      body was not thrown in until after midnight’—a sentence sufficiently\n      inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one\n      printed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Were it my purpose,” continued Dupin, “merely to <i>make out a case</i>\n      against this passage of L’Etoile’s argument, I might safely leave it where\n      it is. It is not, however, with L’Etoile that we have to do, but with the\n      truth. The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it stands; and\n      this meaning I have fairly stated; but it is material that we go behind\n      the mere words, for an idea which these words have obviously intended, and\n      failed to convey. It was the design of the journalist to say that, at\n      whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed,\n      it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the\n      corpse to the river before midnight. And herein lies, really, the\n      assumption of which I complain. It is assumed that the murder was\n      committed at such a position, and under such circumstances, that the\n      bearing it to the river became necessary. Now, the assassination might\n      have taken place upon the river’s brink, or on the river itself; and,\n      thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to, at\n      any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate\n      mode of disposal. You will understand that I suggest nothing here as\n      probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion. My design, so far,\n      has no reference to the facts of the case. I wish merely to caution you\n      against the whole tone of L’Etoile’s suggestion, by calling your attention\n      to its ex parte character at the outset.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions;\n      having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it could have been in\n      the water but a very brief time, the journal goes on to say:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the\n      water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days\n      for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the\n      water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at\n      least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in Paris, with\n      the exception of Le Moniteur. (*15) This latter print endeavors to combat\n      that portion of the paragraph which has reference to ‘drowned bodies’\n      only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of\n      individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of\n      less time than is insisted upon by L’Etoile. But there is something\n      excessively unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of Le Moniteur, to\n      rebut the general assertion of L’Etoile, by a citation of particular\n      instances militating against that assertion. Had it been possible to\n      adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end\n      of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been properly\n      regarded only as exceptions to L’Etoile’s rule, until such time as the\n      rule itself should be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this Le Moniteur\n      does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the argument of\n      L’Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument does not\n      pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body\n      having risen to the surface in less than three days; and this probability\n      will be in favor of L’Etoile’s position until the instances so childishly\n      adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged, if\n      at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the\n      rationale of the rule. Now the human body, in general, is neither much\n      lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say, the\n      specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about\n      equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies of fat and\n      fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than\n      those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of\n      the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide\n      from sea. But, leaving this tide out of question, it may be said that very\n      few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own\n      accord. Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if\n      he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in\n      comparison with his own—that is to say, if he suffer his whole\n      person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible. The proper\n      position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on\n      land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and\n      nostrils alone remaining above the surface. Thus circumstanced, we shall\n      find that we float without difficulty and without exertion. It is evident,\n      however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water\n      displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either\n      to preponderate. An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus\n      deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the\n      whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will\n      enable us to elevate the head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles\n      of one unused to swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upwards, while\n      an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position.\n      The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception,\n      during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the\n      lungs. Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes\n      heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally\n      distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them.\n      This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general\n      rule; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and\n      an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals float\n      even after drowning.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there remain\n      until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less than that of\n      the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect is brought about by\n      decomposition, or otherwise. The result of decomposition is the generation\n      of gas, distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving\n      the puffed appearance which is so horrible. When this distension has so\n      far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without\n      a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes\n      less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its\n      appearance at the surface. But decomposition is modified by innumerable\n      circumstances—is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for\n      example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or\n      purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or\n      stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom\n      from disease before death. Thus it is evident that we can assign no\n      period, with any thing like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise\n      through decomposition. Under certain conditions this result would be\n      brought about within an hour; under others, it might not take place at\n      all. There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be\n      preserved forever from corruption; the bi-chloride of mercury is one. But,\n      apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation\n      of gas within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable\n      matter (or within other cavities from other causes), sufficient to induce a\n      distension which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced\n      by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either\n      loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus\n      permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so\n      doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the\n      cellular tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of\n      the gas.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can easily\n      test by it the assertions of L’Etoile. ‘All experience shows,’ says this\n      paper, ‘that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately\n      after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient\n      decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even\n      when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or\n      six days’ immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence and\n      incoherence. All experience does not show that ‘drowned bodies’ require\n      from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring\n      them to the surface. Both science and experience show that the period of\n      their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If, moreover, a\n      body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will not ‘sink\n      again if let alone,’ until decomposition has so far progressed as to\n      permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to call your attention\n      to the distinction which is made between ‘drowned bodies,’ and ‘bodies\n      thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.’ Although the\n      writer admits the distinction, he yet includes them all in the same\n      category. I have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes\n      specifically heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not sink at\n      all, except for the struggles by which he elevates his arms above the\n      surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface—gasps\n      which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs. But\n      these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body ‘thrown into\n      the water immediately after death by violence.’ Thus, in the latter\n      instance, the body, as a general rule, would not sink at all—a fact\n      of which L’Etoile is evidently ignorant. When decomposition had proceeded\n      to a very great extent—when the flesh had in a great measure left\n      the bones—then, indeed, but not till then, should we lose sight of\n      the corpse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could\n      not be that of Marie Rogêt, because, three days only having\n      elapsed, this body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman, she\n      might never have sunk; or having sunk, might have reappeared in\n      twenty-four hours, or less. But no one supposes her to have been drowned;\n      and, dying before being thrown into the river, she might have been found\n      floating at any period afterwards whatever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘But,’ says L’Etoile, ‘if the body had been kept in its mangled state on\n      shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the\n      murderers.’ Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the\n      reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to\n      his theory—viz.: that the body was kept on shore two days, suffering\n      rapid decomposition—more rapid than if immersed in water. He\n      supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the\n      surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances it\n      could so have appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it was not\n      kept on shore; for, if so, ‘some trace would be found on shore of the\n      murderers.’ I presume you smile at the sequitur. You cannot be made to see\n      how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply\n      traces of the assassins. Nor can I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,’ continues our journal,\n      ‘that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed,\n      would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a\n      precaution could have so easily been taken.’ Observe, here, the laughable\n      confusion of thought! No one—not even L’Etoile—disputes the\n      murder committed <i>on the body found</i>. The marks of violence are too\n      obvious. It is our reasoner’s object merely to show that this body is not\n      Marie’s. He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated—not that\n      the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter point. Here\n      is a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in, would not\n      have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in by\n      murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question of\n      identity is not even approached, and L’Etoile has been at great pains\n      merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before. ‘We are\n      perfectly convinced,’ it says, ‘that the body found was that of a murdered\n      female.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his subject,\n      where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself. His evident\n      object, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as possible, the\n      interval between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the corpse. Yet\n      we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment\n      of her leaving her mother’s house. ‘We have no evidence,’ he says, ‘that\n      Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o’clock on\n      Sunday, June the twenty-second.’ As his argument is obviously an ex parte\n      one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for had any\n      one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, the interval in\n      question would have been much reduced, and, by his own ratiocination, the\n      probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the grisette. It\n      is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that L’Etoile insists upon its point\n      in the full belief of its furthering its general argument.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the\n      identification of the corpse by Beauvais. In regard to the hair upon the\n      arm, L’Etoile has been obviously disingenuous. M. Beauvais, not being an\n      idiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse, simply\n      hair upon its arm. No arm is without hair. The generality of the\n      expression of L’Etoile is a mere perversion of the witness’ phraseology.\n      He must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been a\n      peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Her foot,’ says the journal, ‘was small—so are thousands of feet.\n      Her garter is no proof whatever—nor is her shoe—for shoes and\n      garters are sold in packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her\n      hat. One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp\n      on the garter found, had been set back to take it in. This amounts to\n      nothing; for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and\n      fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try\n      them in the store where they purchase.’ Here it is difficult to suppose\n      the reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of\n      Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to\n      the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to the\n      question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search had\n      been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size and contour,\n      he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had\n      observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly\n      strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the\n      ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark. If, the feet\n      of Marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of\n      probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an increase in a\n      ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative.\n      Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of\n      her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be ‘sold in packages,’\n      you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain. What, of\n      itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes through its\n      corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then, flowers in the hat\n      corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek for nothing\n      farther. If only one flower, we seek for nothing farther—what then\n      if two or three, or more? Each successive one is multiple evidence—proof\n      not <i>added</i> to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands. Let us\n      now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and it\n      is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are found to be tightened,\n      by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own had been\n      tightened by Marie, shortly previous to her leaving home. It is now\n      madness or hypocrisy to doubt. What L’Etoile says in respect to this\n      abbreviation of the garters being an usual occurrence, shows nothing\n      beyond its own pertinacity in error. The elastic nature of the\n      clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation.\n      What is made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign\n      adjustment but rarely. It must have been by an accident, in its strictest\n      sense, that these garters of Marie needed the tightening described. They\n      alone would have amply established her identity. But it is not that the\n      corpse was found to have the garters of the missing girl, or found to have\n      her shoes, or her bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a\n      peculiar mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance—it is\n      that the corpse had each, and <i>all collectively</i>. Could it be proved\n      that the editor of L’Etoile <i>really</i> entertained a doubt, under the\n      circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a commission de\n      lunatico inquirendo. He has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of\n      the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves with echoing the\n      rectangular precepts of the courts. I would here observe that very much of\n      what is rejected as evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the\n      intellect. For the court, guiding itself by the general principles of\n      evidence—the recognized and <i>booked</i> principles—is averse\n      from swerving at particular instances. And this steadfast adherence to\n      principle, with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure\n      mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth, in any long sequence of\n      time. The practice, in mass, is therefore philosophical; but it is not the\n      less certain that it engenders vast individual error. (*16)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will be willing\n      to dismiss them in a breath. You have already fathomed the true character\n      of this good gentleman. He is a busy-body, with much of romance and little\n      of wit. Any one so constituted will readily so conduct himself, upon\n      occasion of real excitement, as to render himself liable to suspicion on\n      the part of the over acute, or the ill-disposed. M. Beauvais (as it\n      appears from your notes) had some personal interviews with the editor of\n      L’Etoile, and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse,\n      notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober fact, that of\n      Marie. ‘He persists,’ says the paper, ‘in asserting the corpse to be that\n      of Marie, but cannot give a circumstance, in addition to those which we\n      have commented upon, to make others believe.’ Now, without re-adverting to\n      the fact that stronger evidence ‘to make others believe,’ could never have\n      been adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to\n      believe, in a case of this kind, without the ability to advance a single\n      reason for the belief of a second party. Nothing is more vague than\n      impressions of individual identity. Each man recognizes his neighbor, yet\n      there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for\n      his recognition. The editor of L’Etoile had no right to be offended at M.\n      Beauvais’ unreasoning belief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found to tally\n      much better with my hypothesis of romantic busy-bodyism, than with the\n      reasoner’s suggestion of guilt. Once adopting the more charitable\n      interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in\n      the key-hole; the ‘Marie’ upon the slate; the ‘elbowing the male relatives\n      out of the way;’ the ‘aversion to permitting them to see the body;’ the\n      caution given to Madame B——, that she must hold no\n      conversation with the gendarme until his return (Beauvais’); and, lastly,\n      his apparent determination ‘that nobody should have anything to do with\n      the proceedings except himself.’ It seems to me unquestionable that\n      Beauvais was a suitor of Marie’s; that she coquetted with him; and that he\n      was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and\n      confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the evidence\n      fully rebuts the assertion of L’Etoile, touching the matter of apathy on\n      the part of the mother and other relatives—an apathy inconsistent\n      with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the\n      perfumery-girl—we shall now proceed as if the question of identity\n      were settled to our perfect satisfaction.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And what,” I here demanded, “do you think of the opinions of Le\n      Commerciel?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which\n      have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises\n      are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at least,\n      are founded in imperfect observation. Le Commerciel wishes to intimate\n      that Marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her\n      mother’s door. ‘It is impossible,’ it urges, ‘that a person so well known\n      to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks\n      without some one having seen her.’ This is the idea of a man long resident\n      in Paris—a public man—and one whose walks to and fro in the\n      city, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices. He\n      is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own\n      bureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent of\n      his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he compares\n      his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great difference\n      between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in her walks,\n      would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his. This could\n      only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying, methodical\n      character, and within the same species of limited region as are his own.\n      He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a confined periphery,\n      abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through\n      interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own. But the\n      walks of Marie may, in general, be supposed discursive. In this particular\n      instance, it will be understood as most probable, that she proceeded upon\n      a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones. The\n      parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of Le Commerciel\n      would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals traversing\n      the whole city. In this case, granting the personal acquaintances to be\n      equal, the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal\n      rencounters would be made. For my own part, I should hold it not only as\n      possible, but as very far more than probable, that Marie might have\n      proceeded, at any given period, by any one of the many routes between her\n      own residence and that of her aunt, without meeting a single individual\n      whom she knew, or by whom she was known. In viewing this question in its\n      full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great\n      disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted\n      individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of Le\n      Commerciel, will be much diminished when we take into consideration the\n      hour at which the girl went abroad. ‘It was when the streets were full of\n      people,’ says Le Commerciel, ‘that she went out.’ But not so. It was at\n      nine o’clock in the morning. Now at nine o’clock of every morning in the\n      week, <i>with the exception of Sunday</i>, the streets of the city are, it\n      is true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are chiefly\n      within doors <i>preparing for church</i>. No observing person can have\n      failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from about eight\n      until ten on the morning of every Sabbath. Between ten and eleven the\n      streets are thronged, but not at so early a period as that designated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation\n      on the part of Le Commerciel. ‘A piece,’ it says, ‘of one of the\n      unfortunate girl’s petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was torn\n      out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to\n      prevent screams. This was done, by fellows who had no\n      pocket-handkerchiefs.’ Whether this idea is, or is not well founded, we\n      will endeavor to see hereafter; but by ‘fellows who have no\n      pocket-handkerchiefs’ the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians.\n      These, however, are the very description of people who will always be\n      found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts. You must have\n      had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to\n      the thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And what are we to think,” I asked, “of the article in Le Soleil?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot—in which\n      case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race. He has\n      merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion;\n      collecting them, with a laudable industry, from this paper and from that.\n      ‘The things had all evidently been there,’ he says, ‘at least, three or\n      four weeks, and there can be <i>no doubt</i> that the spot of this\n      appalling outrage has been discovered.’ The facts here re-stated by Le\n      Soleil, are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject,\n      and we will examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with\n      another division of the theme.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations. You cannot\n      fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the examination of the corpse.\n      To be sure, the question of identity was readily determined, or should\n      have been; but there were other points to be ascertained. Had the body\n      been in any respect despoiled? Had the deceased any articles of jewelry\n      about her person upon leaving home? if so, had she any when found? These\n      are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence; and there are\n      others of equal moment, which have met with no attention. We must endeavor\n      to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry. The case of St. Eustache must be\n      re-examined. I have no suspicion of this person; but let us proceed\n      methodically. We will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the\n      affidavits in regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday. Affidavits of this\n      character are readily made matter of mystification. Should there be\n      nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St. Eustache from our\n      investigations. His suicide, however corroborative of suspicion, were\n      there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is, without such deceit, in no\n      respect an unaccountable circumstance, or one which need cause us to\n      deflect from the line of ordinary analysis.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points of this\n      tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts. Not the least\n      usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of inquiry to\n      the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial\n      events. It is the mal-practice of the courts to confine evidence and\n      discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet experience has shown,\n      and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger\n      portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant. It is through the\n      spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its letter, that modern\n      science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen. But perhaps you do\n      not comprehend me. The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly\n      shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are\n      indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has\n      at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to\n      make not only large, but the largest allowances for inventions that shall\n      arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation. It is\n      no longer philosophical to base, upon what has been, a vision of what is\n      to be. Accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure. We make\n      chance a matter of absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and\n      unimagined to the mathematical <i>formulae</i> of the schools.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I repeat that it is no more than fact, that the larger portion of all\n      truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in accordance with the\n      spirit of the principle involved in this fact, that I would divert\n      inquiry, in the present case, from the trodden and hitherto unfruitful\n      ground of the event itself, to the contemporary circumstances which\n      surround it. While you ascertain the validity of the affidavits, I will\n      examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done. So far,\n      we have only reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be\n      strange indeed if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the public\n      prints, will not afford us some minute points which shall establish a\n      direction for inquiry.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In pursuance of Dupin’s suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of the\n      affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction of their\n      validity, and of the consequent innocence of St. Eustache. In the mean\n      time my friend occupied himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness\n      altogether objectless, in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files. At\n      the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to the\n      present, was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie Rogêt,\n      from the parfumerie of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais Royal. At the end\n      of a week, however, she re-appeared at her customary comptoir, as well as\n      ever, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual. It was\n      given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she had merely been on\n      a visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was speedily hushed\n      up. We presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature, and\n      that, at the expiration of a week, or perhaps of a month, we shall have\n      her among us again.”—Evening Paper—Monday, June 23. (*17)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “An evening journal of yesterday, refers to a former mysterious\n      disappearance of Mademoiselle Rogêt. It is well known that, during\n      the week of her absence from Le Blanc’s parfumerie, she was in the company\n      of a young naval officer, much noted for his debaucheries. A quarrel, it\n      is supposed, providentially led to her return home. We have the name of\n      the Lothario in question, who is, at present, stationed in Paris, but, for\n      obvious reasons, forbear to make it public.”—Le Mercurie—Tuesday\n      Morning, June 24. (*18)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “An outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this city\n      the day before yesterday. A gentleman, with his wife and daughter,\n      engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing a\n      boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the\n      river. Upon reaching the opposite shore, the three passengers stepped out,\n      and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat, when the\n      daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol. She returned for\n      it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged, brutally\n      treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at\n      which she had originally entered the boat with her parents. The villains\n      have escaped for the time, but the police are upon their trail, and some\n      of them will soon be taken.”—Morning Paper—June 25. (*19)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We have received one or two communications, the object of which is to\n      fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon Mennais; (*20) but as this\n      gentleman has been fully exonerated by a loyal inquiry, and as the\n      arguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than\n      profound, we do not think it advisable to make them public.”—Morning\n      Paper—June 28. (*21)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We have received several forcibly written communications, apparently from\n      various sources, and which go far to render it a matter of certainty that\n      the unfortunate Marie Rogêt has become a victim of one of the\n      numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city upon\n      Sunday. Our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this supposition. We\n      shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments hereafter.”—Evening\n      Paper—Tuesday, June 31. (*22)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “On Monday, one of the bargemen connected with the revenue service, saw a\n      empty boat floating down the Seine. Sails were lying in the bottom of the\n      boat. The bargeman towed it under the barge office. The next morning it\n      was taken from thence, without the knowledge of any of the officers. The\n      rudder is now at the barge office.”—Le Diligence—Thursday,\n      June 26.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me\n      irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be\n      brought to bear upon the matter in hand. I waited for some explanation\n      from Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is not my present design,” he said, “to dwell upon the first and\n      second of those extracts. I have copied them chiefly to show you the\n      extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from the\n      Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an examination\n      of the naval officer alluded to. Yet it is mere folly to say that between\n      the first and second disappearance of Marie there is no <i>supposable</i>\n      connection. Let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel\n      between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed. We are now\n      prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an elopement has\n      again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the betrayer’s advances,\n      rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual—we\n      are prepared to regard it as a ‘making up’ of the old amour, rather than\n      as the commencement of a new one. The chances are ten to one, that he who\n      had once eloped with Marie, would again propose an elopement, rather than\n      that she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual,\n      should have them made to her by another. And here let me call your\n      attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first\n      ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is a few months more than\n      the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war. Had the lover been\n      interrupted in his first villany by the necessity of departure to sea, and\n      had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not\n      yet altogether accomplished—or not yet altogether accomplished by <i>him?</i>\n      Of all these things we know nothing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no\n      elopement as imagined. Certainly not—but are we prepared to say that\n      there was not the frustrated design? Beyond St. Eustache, and perhaps\n      Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of Marie.\n      Of none other is there any thing said. Who, then, is the secret lover, of\n      whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom Marie\n      meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence,\n      that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening\n      descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du Roule? Who is\n      that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know\n      nothing? And what means the singular prophecy of Madame Rogêt on\n      the morning of Marie’s departure?—‘I fear that I shall never see\n      Marie again.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But if we cannot imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of\n      elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the\n      girl? Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about\n      to visit her aunt in the Rue des Drômes and St. Eustache was\n      requested to call for her at dark. Now, at first glance, this fact\n      strongly militates against my suggestion;—but let us reflect. That\n      she did meet some companion, and proceed with him across the river,\n      reaching the Barrière du Roule at so late an hour as three o’clock\n      in the afternoon, is known. But in consenting so to accompany this\n      individual, (<i>for whatever purpose—to her mother known or unknown,</i>)\n      she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of\n      the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor,\n      St. Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des\n      Drômes, he should find that she had not been there, and when,\n      moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence,\n      he should become aware of her continued absence from home. She must have\n      thought of these things, I say. She must have foreseen the chagrin of St.\n      Eustache, the suspicion of all. She could not have thought of returning to\n      brave this suspicion; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial\n      importance to her, if we suppose her not intending to return.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We may imagine her thinking thus—‘I am to meet a certain person for\n      the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to\n      myself. It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption—there\n      must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit—I will give it to\n      be understood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue\n      des Drômes—I well tell St. Eustache not to call for me until\n      dark—in this way, my absence from home for the longest possible\n      period, without causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I\n      shall gain more time than in any other manner. If I bid St. Eustache call\n      for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but, if I wholly\n      neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it\n      will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner\n      excite anxiety. Now, if it were my design to return at all—if I had\n      in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question—it\n      would not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be\n      sure to ascertain that I have played him false—a fact of which I\n      might keep him for ever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying\n      him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I\n      had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes. But, as it is my\n      design never to return—or not for some weeks—or not until\n      certain concealments are effected—the gaining of time is the only\n      point about which I need give myself any concern.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in\n      relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl had\n      been the victim of a gang of blackguards. Now, the popular opinion, under\n      certain conditions, is not to be disregarded. When arising of itself—when\n      manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner—we should look\n      upon it as analogous with that <i>intuition</i> which is the idiosyncrasy\n      of the individual man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I\n      would abide by its decision. But it is important that we find no palpable\n      traces of <i>suggestion</i>. The opinion must be rigorously <i>the\n      public’s own</i>; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to\n      perceive and to maintain. In the present instance, it appears to me that\n      this ‘public opinion’ in respect to a gang, has been superinduced by the\n      collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts. All Paris\n      is excited by the discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful and\n      notorious. This corpse is found, bearing marks of violence, and floating\n      in the river. But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about\n      the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated,\n      an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although\n      less in extent, was perpetuated, by a gang of young ruffians, upon the\n      person of a second young female. Is it wonderful that the one known\n      atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other\n      unknown? This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage seemed so\n      opportunely to afford it! Marie, too, was found in the river; and upon\n      this very river was this known outrage committed. The connexion of the two\n      events had about it so much of the palpable, that the true wonder would\n      have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it. But, in\n      fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing,\n      evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so\n      committed. It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of\n      ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong,\n      there should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the\n      same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and\n      appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely\n      the same period of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of\n      coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call\n      upon us to believe?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the\n      assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This\n      thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road.\n      Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back\n      and footstool. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the\n      second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief, were\n      also here found. The handkerchief bore the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’\n      Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was\n      trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a\n      violent struggle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket\n      was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it was supposed to\n      indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be admitted that there\n      was some very good reason for doubt. That it was the scene, I may or I may\n      not believe—but there was excellent reason for doubt. Had the true\n      scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavée\n      St. Andrée, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still\n      resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror at the\n      public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel; and, in\n      certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the\n      necessity of some exertion to redivert this attention. And thus, the\n      thicket of the Barrière du Roule having been already suspected, the\n      idea of placing the articles where they were found, might have been\n      naturally entertained. There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so\n      supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days\n      in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could\n      not have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty\n      days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which they\n      were found by the boys. ‘They were all <i>mildewed</i> down hard,’ says Le\n      Soleil, adopting the opinions of its predecessors, ‘with the action of the\n      rain, and stuck together from <i>mildew</i>. The grass had grown around\n      and over some of them. The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads\n      of it were run together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled\n      and folded, was all <i>mildewed</i> and rotten, and tore on being opened.’\n      In respect to the grass having ‘grown around and over some of them,’ it is\n      obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words, and\n      thus from the recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the\n      articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party.\n      But grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather, (such as was\n      that of the period of the murder,) as much as two or three inches in a\n      single day. A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single\n      week, be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. And\n      touching that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously\n      insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief\n      paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew?\n      Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which\n      the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within\n      twenty-four hours?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced in\n      support of the idea that the articles had been ‘for at least three or four\n      weeks’ in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of\n      that fact. On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that\n      these articles could have remained in the thicket specified, for a longer\n      period than a single week—for a longer period than from one Sunday\n      to the next. Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the\n      extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great distance from\n      its suburbs. Such a thing as an unexplored, or even an unfrequently\n      visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be\n      imagined. Let any one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet\n      chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis—let\n      any such one attempt, even during the weekdays, to slake his thirst for\n      solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround\n      us. At every second step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the\n      voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing\n      blackguards. He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain.\n      Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound—here are the\n      temples most desecrate. With sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee\n      back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less incongruous\n      sink of pollution. But if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the\n      working days of the week, how much more so on the Sabbath! It is now\n      especially that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the\n      customary opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts\n      of the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he\n      despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities\n      of society. He desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the\n      utter license of the country. Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the\n      foliage of the woods, he indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of\n      his boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity—the\n      joint offspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than what must\n      be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the\n      circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered, for\n      a longer period than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in\n      the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less\n      than miraculous.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the\n      articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention\n      from the real scene of the outrage. And, first, let me direct your notice\n      to the date of the discovery of the articles. Collate this with the date\n      of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. You will find\n      that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications\n      sent to the evening paper. These communications, although various and\n      apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point—viz.,\n      the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage,\n      and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its scene. Now\n      here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these\n      communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles\n      were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been,\n      that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that\n      the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited\n      there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the\n      date of the communication, by the guilty authors of these communications\n      themselves.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This thicket was a singular—an exceedingly singular one. It was\n      unusually dense. Within its naturally walled enclosure were three\n      extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and footstool. And this\n      thicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate vicinity, within a\n      few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the habit of\n      closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the\n      sassafras. Would it be a rash wager—a wager of one thousand to one—that\n      a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least\n      one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its\n      natural throne? Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have either\n      never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish nature. I repeat—it\n      is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in\n      this thicket undiscovered, for a longer period than one or two days; and\n      that thus there is good ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic\n      ignorance of Le Soleil, that they were, at a comparatively late date,\n      deposited where found.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so\n      deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now, let me beg your\n      notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles. On the <i>upper</i>\n      stone lay a white petticoat; on the <i>second</i>, a silk scarf; scattered around,\n      were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name, ‘Marie\n      Rogêt.’ Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made\n      by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. But\n      it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I should rather have\n      looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot.\n      In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have been scarcely possible\n      that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the\n      stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling\n      persons. ‘There was evidence,’ it is said, ‘of a struggle; and the earth\n      was trampled, the bushes were broken,’—but the petticoat and the\n      scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. ‘The pieces of the frock\n      torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long.\n      One part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended. They looked like\n      strips torn off.’ Here, inadvertently, Le Soleil has employed an\n      exceedingly suspicious phrase. The pieces, as described, do indeed ‘look\n      like strips torn off;’ but purposely and by hand. It is one of the rarest\n      of accidents that a piece is ‘torn off,’ from any garment such as is now\n      in question, by the agency of a thorn. From the very nature of such\n      fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them, tears them\n      rectangularly—divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right\n      angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters—but\n      it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece ‘torn off.’ I never so knew\n      it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such fabric, two distinct\n      forces, in different directions, will be, in almost every case, required.\n      If there be two edges to the fabric—if, for example, it be a\n      pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and\n      then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But in the present case\n      the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge. To tear a piece from\n      the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a\n      miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could accomplish\n      it. But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary,\n      operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in one. And\n      this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed. If hemmed, the matter\n      is nearly out of the question. We thus see the numerous and great\n      obstacles in the way of pieces being ‘torn off’ through the simple agency\n      of ‘thorns;’ yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but\n      that many have been so torn. ‘And one part,’ too, ‘was the hem of the\n      frock!’ Another piece was ‘part of the skirt, not the hem,’—that is\n      to say, was torn completely out through the agency of thorns, from the\n      uncaged interior of the dress! These, I say, are things which one may well\n      be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps,\n      less of reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling\n      circumstance of the articles’ having been left in this thicket at all, by\n      any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse.\n      You will not have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my\n      design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might have\n      been a wrong here, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc’s. But,\n      in fact, this is a point of minor importance. We are not engaged in an\n      attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the\n      murder. What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I\n      have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the\n      positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly,\n      to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of the\n      doubt whether this assassination has, or has not, been the work of a gang.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of\n      the surgeon examined at the inquest. It is only necessary to say that his\n      published inferences, in regard to the number of ruffians, have been\n      properly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable\n      anatomists of Paris. Not that the matter might not have been as inferred,\n      but that there was no ground for the inference:—was there not much\n      for another?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us reflect now upon ‘the traces of a struggle;’ and let me ask what\n      these traces have been supposed to demonstrate. A gang. But do they not\n      rather demonstrate the absence of a gang? What struggle could have taken\n      place—what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its\n      ‘traces’ in all directions—between a weak and defenceless girl and\n      the gang of ruffians imagined? The silent grasp of a few rough arms and\n      all would have been over. The victim must have been absolutely passive at\n      their will. You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against\n      the thicket as the scene, are applicable in chief part, only against it as\n      the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual. If we\n      imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive, the\n      struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the\n      ‘traces’ apparent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And again. I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the\n      fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the\n      thicket where discovered. It seems almost impossible that these evidences\n      of guilt should have been accidentally left where found. There was\n      sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse; and yet\n      a more positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features might have\n      been quickly obliterated by decay,) is allowed to lie conspicuously in the\n      scene of the outrage—I allude to the handkerchief with the name of\n      the deceased. If this was accident, it was not the accident of a gang. We\n      can imagine it only the accident of an individual. Let us see. An\n      individual has committed the murder. He is alone with the ghost of the\n      departed. He is appalled by what lies motionless before him. The fury of\n      his passion is over, and there is abundant room in his heart for the\n      natural awe of the deed. His is none of that confidence which the presence\n      of numbers inevitably inspires. He is alone with the dead. He trembles and\n      is bewildered. Yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse. He\n      bears it to the river, but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt;\n      for it is difficult, if not impossible to carry all the burthen at once,\n      and it will be easy to return for what is left. But in his toilsome\n      journey to the water his fears redouble within him. The sounds of life\n      encompass his path. A dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an\n      observer. Even the very lights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time\n      and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, he reaches the river’s\n      brink, and disposes of his ghastly charge—perhaps through the medium\n      of a boat. But now what treasure does the world hold—what threat of\n      vengeance could it hold out—which would have power to urge the\n      return of that lonely murderer over that toilsome and perilous path, to\n      the thicket and its blood chilling recollections? He returns not, let the\n      consequences be what they may. He could not return if he would. His sole\n      thought is immediate escape. He turns his back forever upon those dreadful\n      shrubberies and flees as from the wrath to come.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But how with a gang? Their number would have inspired them with\n      confidence; if, indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the\n      arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the supposed gangs\n      ever constituted. Their number, I say, would have prevented the\n      bewildering and unreasoning terror which I have imagined to paralyze the\n      single man. Could we suppose an oversight in one, or two, or three, this\n      oversight would have been remedied by a fourth. They would have left\n      nothing behind them; for their number would have enabled them to carry all\n      at once. There would have been no need of return.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the corpse\n      when found, ‘a slip, about a foot wide had been torn upward from the\n      bottom hem to the waist wound three times round the waist, and secured by\n      a sort of hitch in the back.’ This was done with the obvious design of\n      affording a handle by which to carry the body. But would any number of men\n      have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient? To three or four, the\n      limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the\n      best possible hold. The device is that of a single individual; and this\n      brings us to the fact that ‘between the thicket and the river, the rails\n      of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident traces of\n      some heavy burden having been dragged along it!’ But would a number of men\n      have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for\n      the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted\n      over any fence in an instant? Would a number of men have so dragged a\n      corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the dragging?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an observation\n      upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. ‘A piece,’ says\n      this journal, ‘of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats was torn out\n      and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to\n      prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no\n      pocket-handkerchiefs.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a\n      pocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I now especially\n      advert. That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose\n      imagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was employed, is rendered\n      apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object was\n      not ‘to prevent screams’ appears, also, from the bandage having been\n      employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the\n      purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question\n      as ‘found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.’\n      These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially from those of Le\n      Commerciel. The slip was eighteen inches wide, and therefore, although of\n      muslin, would form a strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally.\n      And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference is this. The solitary\n      murderer, having borne the corpse, for some distance (whether from the\n      thicket or elsewhere) by means of the bandage hitched around its middle,\n      found the weight, in this mode of procedure, too much for his strength. He\n      resolved to drag the burthen—the evidence goes to show that it was\n      dragged. With this object in view, it became necessary to attach something\n      like a rope to one of the extremities. It could be best attached about the\n      neck, where the head would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the\n      murderer bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He\n      would have used this, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch\n      which embarrassed it, and the reflection that it had not been ‘torn off’\n      from the garment. It was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat. He\n      tore it, made it fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the\n      brink of the river. That this ‘bandage,’ only attainable with trouble and\n      delay, and but imperfectly answering its purpose—that this bandage\n      was employed at all, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment\n      sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no\n      longer attainable—that is to say, arising, as we have imagined,\n      after quitting the thicket, (if the thicket it was), and on the road\n      between the thicket and the river.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc (!) points especially to\n      the presence of a gang, in the vicinity of the thicket, at or about the\n      epoch of the murder. This I grant. I doubt if there were not a dozen\n      gangs, such as described by Madame Deluc, in and about the vicinity of the\n      Barrière du Roule at or about the period of this tragedy. But the\n      gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, although the\n      somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of Madame Deluc, is the only\n      gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old lady as having\n      eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy, without putting themselves to\n      the trouble of making her payment. Et hinc illæ iræ?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But what is the precise evidence of Madame Deluc? ‘A gang of miscreants\n      made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making\n      payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the\n      inn about dusk, and recrossed the river as if in great haste.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Now this ‘great haste’ very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of\n      Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her\n      violated cakes and ale—cakes and ale for which she might still have\n      entertained a faint hope of compensation. Why, otherwise, since it was\n      about dusk, should she make a point of the haste? It is no cause for\n      wonder, surely, that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get\n      home, when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm\n      impends, and when night approaches.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only about\n      dusk that the indecent haste of these ‘miscreants’ offended the sober eyes\n      of Madame Deluc. But we are told that it was upon this very evening that\n      Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, ‘heard the screams of a female in\n      the vicinity of the inn.’ And in what words does Madame Deluc designate\n      the period of the evening at which these screams were heard? ‘It was soon\n      after dark,’ she says. But ‘soon after dark,’ is, at least, dark; and\n      ‘about dusk’ is as certainly daylight. Thus it is abundantly clear that\n      the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the screams\n      overheard (?) by Madame Deluc. And although, in all the many reports of\n      the evidence, the relative expressions in question are distinctly and\n      invariably employed just as I have employed them in this conversation with\n      yourself, no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been\n      taken by any of the public journals, or by any of the myrmidons of police.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this one has, to\n      my own understanding at least, a weight altogether irresistible. Under the\n      circumstances of large reward offered, and full pardon to any king’s\n      evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a moment, that some member of a\n      gang of low ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long ago have\n      betrayed his accomplices. Each one of a gang so placed, is not so much\n      greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal. He\n      betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed. That the\n      secret has not been divulged, is the very best of proof that it is, in\n      fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to one, or\n      two, living human beings, and to God.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis. We\n      have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of Madame\n      Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated, in the thicket at the Barrière\n      du Roule, by a lover, or at least by an intimate and secret associate of\n      the deceased. This associate is of swarthy complexion. This complexion,\n      the ‘hitch’ in the bandage, and the ‘sailor’s knot,’ with which the\n      bonnet-ribbon is tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the\n      deceased, a gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as above the\n      grade of the common sailor. Here the well written and urgent\n      communications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration. The\n      circumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends to\n      blend the idea of this seaman with that of the ‘naval officer’ who is\n      first known to have led the unfortunate into crime.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued absence of\n      him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe that the complexion of\n      this man is dark and swarthy; it was no common swarthiness which\n      constituted the sole point of remembrance, both as regards Valence and\n      Madame Deluc. But why is this man absent? Was he murdered by the gang? If\n      so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl? The scene of the\n      two outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And where is his\n      corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the\n      same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is deterred from\n      making himself known, through dread of being charged with the murder. This\n      consideration might be supposed to operate upon him now—at this late\n      period—since it has been given in evidence that he was seen with\n      Marie—but it would have had no force at the period of the deed. The\n      first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage,\n      and to aid in identifying the ruffians. This policy would have suggested.\n      He had been seen with the girl. He had crossed the river with her in an\n      open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would have appeared, even\n      to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving himself from\n      suspicion. We cannot suppose him, on the night of the fatal Sunday, both\n      innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed. Yet only under\n      such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed, if\n      alive, in the denouncement of the assassins.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And what means are ours, of attaining the truth? We shall find these\n      means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed. Let us sift to\n      the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let us know the full\n      history of ‘the officer,’ with his present circumstances, and his\n      whereabouts at the precise period of the murder. Let us carefully compare\n      with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper, in\n      which the object was to inculpate a gang. This done, let us compare these\n      communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the\n      morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the\n      guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us again compare these various\n      communications with the known MSS. of the officer. Let us endeavor to\n      ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc and her boys, as well\n      as of the omnibus driver, Valence, something more of the personal\n      appearance and bearing of the ‘man of dark complexion.’ Queries, skilfully\n      directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of these parties, information\n      on this particular point (or upon others)—information which the\n      parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing. And let us now\n      trace the boat picked up by the bargeman on the morning of Monday the\n      twenty-third of June, and which was removed from the barge-office, without\n      the cognizance of the officer in attendance, and without the rudder, at\n      some period prior to the discovery of the corpse. With a proper caution\n      and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the\n      bargeman who picked it up identify it, but the rudder is at hand. The\n      rudder of a sail-boat would not have been abandoned, without inquiry, by\n      one altogether at ease in heart. And here let me pause to insinuate a\n      question. There was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It\n      was silently taken to the barge-office, and as silently removed. But its\n      owner or employer—how happened he, at so early a period as Tuesday\n      morning, to be informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the\n      locality of the boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connexion\n      with the navy—some personal permanent connexion leading to\n      cognizance of its minute in interests—its petty local news?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore, I\n      have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a boat.\n      Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt was precipitated from a\n      boat. This would naturally have been the case. The corpse could not have\n      been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore. The peculiar marks on the\n      back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat. That\n      the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea. If\n      thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can only\n      account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the\n      precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off. In the act of\n      consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have noticed\n      his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand. Any risk would\n      have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore. Having rid himself\n      of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have hastened to the city.\n      There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped on land. But the boat—would\n      he have secured it? He would have been in too great haste for such things\n      as securing a boat. Moreover, in fastening it to the wharf, he would have\n      felt as if securing evidence against himself. His natural thought would\n      have been to cast from him, as far as possible, all that had held\n      connection with his crime. He would not only have fled from the wharf, but\n      he would not have permitted the boat to remain. Assuredly he would have\n      cast it adrift. Let us pursue our fancies.—In the morning, the\n      wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has\n      been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit\n      of frequenting —at a locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him\n      to frequent. The next night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he\n      removes it. Now where is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first\n      purposes to discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of\n      our success shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which\n      will surprise even ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of\n      the fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the\n      murderer will be traced.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      [For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many readers will\n      appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here omitting, from the MSS.\n      placed in our hands, such portion as details the following up of the\n      apparently slight clew obtained by Dupin. We feel it advisable only to\n      state, in brief, that the result desired was brought to pass; and that the\n      Prefect fulfilled punctually, although with reluctance, the terms of his\n      compact with the Chevalier. Mr. Poe’s article concludes with the following\n      words.—Eds. (*23)]\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It will be understood that I speak of coincidences and no more. What I\n      have said above upon this topic must suffice. In my own heart there dwells\n      no faith in præter-nature. That Nature and its God are two, no man\n      who thinks, will deny. That the latter, creating the former, can, at will,\n      control or modify it, is also unquestionable. I say “at will;” for the\n      question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of\n      power. It is not that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we insult\n      him in imagining a possible necessity for modification. In their origin\n      these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in\n      the Future. With God all is Now.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences. And\n      farther: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of the\n      unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that fate is known, and the fate of\n      one Marie Rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history, there has\n      existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the\n      reason becomes embarrassed. I say all this will be seen. But let it not\n      for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative of\n      Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its dénouement\n      the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert design to hint at an\n      extension of the parallel, or even to suggest that the measures adopted in\n      Paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette, or measures founded\n      in any similar ratiocination, would produce any similar result.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should be\n      considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases\n      might give rise to the most important miscalculations, by diverting\n      thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as, in arithmetic, an\n      error which, in its own individuality, may be inappreciable, produces, at\n      length, by dint of multiplication at all points of the process, a result\n      enormously at variance with truth. And, in regard to the former branch, we\n      must not fail to hold in view that the very Calculus of Probabilities to\n      which I have referred, forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel—forbids\n      it with a positiveness strong and decided just in proportion as this\n      parallel has already been long-drawn and exact. This is one of those\n      anomalous propositions which, seemingly appealing to thought altogether\n      apart from the mathematical, is yet one which only the mathematician can\n      fully entertain. Nothing, for example, is more difficult than to convince\n      the merely general reader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice\n      in succession by a player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the\n      largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. A\n      suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It\n      does not appear that the two throws which have been completed, and which\n      lie now absolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the throw which\n      exists only in the Future. The chance for throwing sixes seems to be\n      precisely as it was at any ordinary time—that is to say, subject\n      only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the\n      dice. And this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that\n      attempts to controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive\n      smile than with anything like respectful attention. The error here\n      involved—a gross error redolent of mischief—I cannot pretend\n      to expose within the limits assigned me at present; and with the\n      philosophical it needs no exposure. It may be sufficient here to say that\n      it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path of\n      Reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail.\n    </p>\n<h3>FOOTNOTES—Marie Rogêt</h3>\n<p>\n      (*1) Upon the original publication of “Marie Roget,” the foot-notes now\n      appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years since\n      the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient to give\n      them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design. A\n      young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the vicinity of New York;\n      and, although her death occasioned an intense and long-enduring\n      excitement, the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period\n      when the present paper was written and published (November, 1842). Herein,\n      under pretence of relating the fate of a Parisian grisette, the author has\n      followed in minute detail, the essential, while merely paralleling the\n      inessential facts of the real murder of Mary Rogers. Thus all argument\n      founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth: and the investigation\n      of the truth was the object. The “Mystery of Marie Roget” was composed at\n      a distance from the scene of the atrocity, and with no other means of\n      investigation than the newspapers afforded. Thus much escaped the writer\n      of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot, and\n      visited the localities. It may not be improper to record, nevertheless,\n      that the confessions of two persons, (one of them the Madame Deluc of the\n      narrative) made, at different periods, long subsequent to the publication,\n      confirmed, in full, not only the general conclusion, but absolutely all\n      the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*2) The nom de plume of Von Hardenburg.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*3) Nassau Street.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*4) Anderson.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*5) The Hudson.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*6) Weehawken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*7) Payne.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*8) Crommelin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*9) The New York “Mercury.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      (*10) The New York “Brother Jonathan,” edited by H.

Signal Triumph of Mr. Monck Mason’s Flying\nMachine!—Arrival at Sullivan’s Island, near Charlestown, S.C., of\nMr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, and four\nothers, in the Steering Balloon, “Victoria,” after a passage of\nSeventy-five Hours from Land to Land!  Full Particulars of the Voyage!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjoined <i>jeu d’esprit</i> with the preceding heading in\nmagnificent capitals, well interspersed with notes of admiration, was\noriginally published, as matter of fact, in the “New York Sun,” a\ndaily newspaper, and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating\nindigestible aliment for the <i>quidnuncs</i> during the few hours intervening\nbetween a couple of the Charleston mails.  The rush for the “sole paper\nwhich had the news,” was something beyond even the prodigious;  and, in\nfact, if (as some assert) the “Victoria” <i>did</i> not absolutely\naccomplish the voyage recorded, it will be difficult to assign a reason why she\n<i>should</i> not have accomplished it.]\n</p>\n<p>\n      The great problem is at length solved! The air, as well as the earth and\n      the ocean, has been subdued by science, and will become a common and\n      convenient highway for mankind. <i>The Atlantic has been actually crossed\n      in a Balloon!</i> and this too without difficulty—without any great\n      apparent danger—with thorough control of the machine—and in\n      the inconceivably brief period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!\n      By the energy of an agent at Charleston, S.C., we are enabled to be the\n      first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most\n      extraordinary voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th\n      instant, at 11, A.M., and 2, P.M., on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir\n      Everard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck’s; Mr. Monck\n      Mason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known æronauts; Mr. Harrison\n      Ainsworth, author of “Jack Sheppard,” &amp;c.; and Mr. Henson, the\n      projector of the late unsuccessful flying machine—with two seamen\n      from Woolwich—in all, eight persons. The particulars furnished below\n      may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with a\n      slight exception, they are copied <i>verbatim</i> from the joint diaries\n      of Mr. Monck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our\n      agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon\n      itself, its construction, and other matters of interest. The only\n      alteration in the MS. received, has been made for the purpose of throwing\n      the hurried account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and\n      intelligible form.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “THE BALLOON.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Two very decided failures, of late—those of Mr. Henson and Sir\n      George Cayley—had much weakened the public interest in the subject\n      of aerial navigation. Mr. Henson’s scheme (which at first was considered\n      very feasible even by men of science,) was founded upon the principle of\n      an inclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied\n      and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number\n      resembling the vanes of a windmill. But, in all the experiments made with\n      models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these\n      fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its flight.\n      The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere <i>impetus</i>\n      acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this <i>impetus</i>\n      carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than when they\n      were in motion—a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their\n      inutility; and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the <i>sustaining</i>\n      power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend. This consideration led\n      Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine\n      having of itself an independent power of support—in a word, to a\n      balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original, with Sir George,\n      only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice. He\n      exhibited a model of his invention at the Polytechnic Institution. The\n      propelling principle, or power, was here, also, applied to interrupted\n      surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution. These vanes were four in number,\n      but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding\n      its ascending power. The whole project was thus a complete failure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to\n      Weilburg in the balloon, “Nassau,” occasioned so much excitement in 1837,)\n      conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean screw for\n      the purpose of propulsion through the air—rightly attributing the\n      failure of Mr. Henson’s scheme, and of Sir George Cayley’s, to the\n      interruption of surface in the independent vanes. He made the first public\n      experiment at Willis’s Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the\n      Adelaide Gallery.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Like Sir George Cayley’s balloon, his own was an ellipsoid. Its length\n      was thirteen feet six inches—height, six feet eight inches. It\n      contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas, which, if pure\n      hydrogen, would support twenty-one pounds upon its first inflation, before\n      the gas has time to deteriorate or escape. The weight of the whole machine\n      and apparatus was seventeen pounds—leaving about four pounds to\n      spare. Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about\n      nine feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the\n      customary manner. From this framework was suspended a wicker basket or\n      car.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen inches in\n      length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at fifteen degrees,\n      pass a series of steel wire radii, two feet long, and thus projecting a\n      foot on either side. These radii are connected at the outer extremities by\n      two bands of flattened wire—the whole in this manner forming the\n      framework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut\n      into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface. At\n      each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass\n      tube descending from the hoop. In the lower ends of these tubes are holes\n      in which the pivots of the axis revolve. From the end of the axis which is\n      next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the\n      pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car. By the operation\n      of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity,\n      communicating a progressive motion to the whole. By means of the rudder,\n      the machine was readily turned in any direction. The spring was of great\n      power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising forty-five\n      pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter, after the first turn, and\n      gradually increasing as it was wound up. It weighed, altogether, eight\n      pounds six ounces. The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk,\n      shaped somewhat like a battle-door, and was about three feet long, and at\n      the widest, one foot. Its weight was about two ounces. It could be turned\n      <i>flat</i>, and directed upwards or downwards, as well as to the right or\n      left; and thus enabled the æronaut to transfer the resistance of\n      the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage, to\n      any side upon which he might desire to act; thus determining the balloon\n      in the opposite direction.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described in\n      an imperfect manner,) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery, where it\n      accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour; although, strange to say,\n      it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex\n      machine of Mr. Henson—so resolute is the world to despise anything\n      which carries with it an air of simplicity. To accomplish the great\n      desideratum of ærial navigation, it was very generally supposed\n      that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some\n      unusually profound principle in dynamics.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of his\n      invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible, a\n      balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some\n      extent—the original design being to cross the British Channel, as\n      before, in the Nassau balloon. To carry out his views, he solicited and\n      obtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two\n      gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the\n      interest they have exhibited in the progress of ærostation. The\n      project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the\n      public—the only persons entrusted with the design being those\n      actually engaged in the construction of the machine, which was built\n      (under the superintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard\n      Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne,) at the seat of the latter gentleman near\n      Penstruthal, in Wales. Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr.\n      Ainsworth, was admitted to a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last—when\n      the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure.\n      We are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in\n      the party—but, in the course of a day or two, we shall put our\n      readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this\n      extraordinary voyage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum\n      caoutchouc. It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic\n      feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive\n      and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when fully\n      inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about 2500\n      pounds. The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily procured\n      and managed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we are\n      indebted to Mr. Charles Green. Up to his discovery, the process of\n      inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain. Two, and even\n      three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a\n      sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had great\n      tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its affinity for\n      the surrounding atmosphere. In a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain\n      its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months,\n      an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for\n      six weeks.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united\n      weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a\n      surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged in\n      bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon them—by\n      cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision for a\n      fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other\n      indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming\n      coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire, if\n      it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, with the\n      exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the hoop\n      overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than the one\n      appended to the model. It is formed of a light wicker, and is wonderfully\n      strong, for so frail looking a machine. Its rim is about four feet deep.\n      The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than that of the\n      model; and the screw is considerably smaller. The balloon is furnished\n      besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of the most\n      indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will here be\n      necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details\n      of aerostation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the influence\n      of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight;\n      augmenting or diminishing its ascending power. For example, there may be a\n      deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even, of several hundred\n      pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the machine may descend.\n      This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew,\n      and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again\n      rapidly ascend. To check this ascent, the only recourse is, (or rather <i>was</i>,\n      until Mr. Green’s invention of the guide-rope,) the permission of the\n      escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss of gas, is a proportionate\n      general loss of ascending power; so that, in a comparatively brief period,\n      the best-constructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources,\n      and come to the earth. This was the great obstacle to voyages of length.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner\n      conceivable. It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from\n      the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing\n      its level in any material degree. If, for example, there should be a\n      deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to descend in\n      consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy\n      the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly\n      just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end\n      of the rope as is necessary. If, on the other hand, any circumstances\n      should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is\n      immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from\n      the earth. Thus, the balloon can neither ascend or descend, except within\n      very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain\n      comparatively unimpaired. When passing over an expanse of water, it\n      becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with\n      liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water. These float, and serve all\n      the purposes of a mere rope on land. Another most important office of the\n      guide-rope, is to point out the <i>direction</i> of the balloon. The rope\n      <i>drags</i>, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the\n      latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is\n      made: a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative\n      positions of the two objects, will always indicate the <i>course</i>. In\n      the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the\n      machine, indicates the <i>velocity</i>. When there is <i>no</i> angle—in\n      other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is\n      stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the\n      balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the\n      converse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as\n      near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare\n      themselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent,\n      specifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau\n      voyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual\n      formalities of office: unexpected events, however, rendered these\n      passports superfluous.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak, on Saturday\n      morning, the 6th instant, in the Court-Yard of Weal-Vor House, Mr.\n      Osborne’s seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7\n      minutes past 11, every thing being ready for departure, the balloon was\n      set free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use\n      being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder. We\n      proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth from the joint\n      MSS. of Mr. Monck Mason, and Mr. Ainsworth. The body of the journal, as\n      given, is in the hand-writing of Mr. Mason, and a P. S. is appended, each\n      day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and will shortly give the\n      public a more minute, and no doubt, a thrillingly interesting account of\n      the voyage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “THE JOURNAL.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Saturday, April the 6th</i>.—Every preparation likely to\n      embarrass us, having been made over night, we commenced the inflation this\n      morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog, which encumbered the folds\n      of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before\n      nearly eleven o’clock. Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently\n      but steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction\n      of the British Channel. Found the ascending force greater than we had\n      expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more\n      in the sun’s rays, our ascent became very rapid. I did not wish, however,\n      to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so concluded to\n      ascend for the present. We soon ran out our guide-rope; but even when we\n      had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very rapidly. The\n      balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully. In about ten minutes\n      after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet. The\n      weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country—a\n      most romantic one when seen from any point,—was now especially\n      sublime. The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes, on\n      account of the dense vapors with which they were filled, and the pinnacles\n      and crags to the South East, piled in inextricable confusion, resembling\n      nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable. We were rapidly\n      approaching the mountains in the South; but our elevation was more than\n      sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety. In a few minutes we soared\n      over them in fine style; and Mr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised\n      at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car, the tendency\n      of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the\n      surface below, to nearly a dead level. At half-past eleven still\n      proceeding nearly South, we obtained our first view of the Bristol\n      Channel; and, in fifteen minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the\n      coast appeared immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea. We\n      now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys\n      affixed, into the water. This was immediately done, and we commenced a\n      gradual descent. In about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the\n      touch of the second soon afterwards, we remained stationary as to\n      elevation. We were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder\n      and screw, and we put them both into requisition forthwith, for the\n      purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward, and in a line for\n      Paris. By means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change\n      of direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of\n      the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced\n      to find it propel us readily as desired. Upon this we gave nine hearty\n      cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle, enclosing a slip of parchment\n      with a brief account of the principle of the invention. Hardly, however,\n      had we done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred\n      which discouraged us in no little degree. The steel rod connecting the\n      spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car\n      end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two\n      seamen we had taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach,\n      from the pivot of the axis of the screw. While we were endeavoring to\n      regain it, our attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in\n      a strong current of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly\n      increasing force, towards the Atlantic. We soon found ourselves driving\n      out to sea at the rate of not less, certainly, than fifty or sixty miles\n      an hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some forty miles to our\n      North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were\n      about. It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary, but to my\n      fancy, a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he\n      was instantly seconded by Mr. Holland—viz.: that we should take\n      advantage of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating\n      back to Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America. After\n      slight reflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which\n      (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only. As the\n      stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely\n      upon our course. We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys\n      materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at\n      command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of\n      ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as\n      brought it quite clear of the sea. We perceived the effect of this\n      manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and, as the\n      gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the\n      guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel. It is\n      needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the\n      coast. We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of which\n      were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to. We occasioned\n      the greatest excitement on board all—an excitement greatly relished\n      by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the influence\n      of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or fear, to the\n      wind. Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all we were saluted\n      with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising distinctness) and the\n      waving of caps and handkerchiefs. We kept on in this manner throughout the\n      day, with no material incident, and, as the shades of night closed around\n      us, we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed. It could not have\n      been less than five hundred miles, and was probably much more. The\n      propeller was kept in constant operation, and, no doubt, aided our\n      progress materially. As the sun went down, the gale freshened into an\n      absolute hurricane, and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account\n      of its phosphorescence. The wind was from the East all night, and gave us\n      the brightest omen of success. We suffered no little from cold, and the\n      dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the\n      car enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few blankets, we\n      did sufficiently well.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “P.S. (by Mr. Ainsworth.) The last nine hours have been unquestionably the\n      most exciting of my life. I can conceive nothing more sublimating than the\n      strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this. May God grant that\n      we succeed! I ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person,\n      but for the sake of human knowledge and—for the vastness of the\n      triumph. And yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole\n      wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before. One single gale such\n      as now befriends us—let such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for\n      four or five days (these gales often last longer) and the voyager will be\n      easily borne, in that period, from coast to coast. In view of such a gale\n      the broad Atlantic becomes a mere lake. I am more struck, just now, with\n      the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us, notwithstanding\n      its agitation, than with any other phenomenon presenting itself. The\n      waters give up no voice to the heavens. The immense flaming ocean writhes\n      and is tortured uncomplainingly. The mountainous surges suggest the idea\n      of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony. In a\n      night such as is this to me, a man <i>lives</i>—lives a whole\n      century of ordinary life—nor would I forego this rapturous delight\n      for that of a whole century of ordinary existence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Sunday, the seventh</i>. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning the gale, by\n      10, had subsided to an eight or nine—knot breeze, (for a vessel at\n      sea,) and bears us, perhaps, thirty miles per hour, or more. It has\n      veered, however, very considerably to the north; and now, at sundown, we\n      are holding our course due west, principally by the screw and rudder,\n      which answer their purposes to admiration. I regard the project as\n      thoroughly successful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction\n      (not exactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical. We could\n      not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday; but, by\n      ascending, we might have got out of its influence, if requisite. Against a\n      pretty stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the\n      propeller. At noon, to-day, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000\n      feet, by discharging ballast. Did this to search for a more direct\n      current, but found none so favorable as the one we are now in. We have an\n      abundance of gas to take us across this small pond, even should the voyage\n      last three weeks. I have not the slightest fear for the result. The\n      difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended. I can choose\n      my current, and should I find <i>all</i> currents against me, I can make\n      very tolerable headway with the propeller. We have had no incidents worth\n      recording. The night promises fair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] I have little to record, except the fact (to me\n      quite a surprising one) that, at an elevation equal to that of Cotopaxi, I\n      experienced neither very intense cold, nor headache, nor difficulty of\n      breathing; neither, I find, did Mr. Mason, nor Mr. Holland, nor Sir\n      Everard. Mr. Osborne complained of constriction of the chest—but\n      this soon wore off. We have flown at a great rate during the day, and we\n      must be more than half way across the Atlantic. We have passed over some\n      twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be delightfully\n      astonished. Crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat\n      after all. <i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico. Mem:</i> at 25,000 feet\n      elevation the sky appears nearly black, and the stars are distinctly\n      visible; while the sea does not seem convex (as one might suppose) but\n      absolutely and most unequivocally <i>concave</i>.(*1)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Monday, the 8th</i>. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning we had again some\n      little trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be entirely\n      remodelled, for fear of serious accident—I mean the steel rod—not\n      the vanes. The latter could not be improved. The wind has been blowing\n      steadily and strongly from the north-east all day and so far fortune seems\n      bent upon favoring us. Just before day, we were all somewhat alarmed at\n      some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied with the\n      apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine. These phenomena were\n      occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in the\n      atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice\n      with which the network had become encrusted during the night. Threw down\n      several bottles to the vessels below. Saw one of them picked up by a large\n      ship—seemingly one of the New York line packets. Endeavored to make\n      out her name, but could not be sure of it. Mr. Osborne’s telescope made it\n      out something like “Atalanta.” It is now 12, at night, and we are still\n      going nearly west, at a rapid pace. The sea is peculiarly phosphorescent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] It is now 2, A.M., and nearly calm, as well as I\n      can judge—but it is very difficult to determine this point, since we\n      move <i>with</i> the air so completely. I have not slept since quitting\n      Wheal-Vor, but can stand it no longer, and must take a nap. We cannot be\n      far from the American coast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Tuesday, the</i> 9<i>th</i>. [Mr. Ainsworth’s MS.] <i>One, P.M. We are\n      in full view of the low coast of South Carolina</i>. The great problem is\n      accomplished. We have crossed the Atlantic—fairly and <i>easily</i>\n      crossed it in a balloon! God be praised! Who shall say that anything is\n      impossible hereafter?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The Journal here ceases. Some particulars of the descent were\n      communicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth. It was nearly dead\n      calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which was\n      immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne. The latter\n      gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was immediately\n      resolved to descend in its vicinity. The balloon was brought over the\n      beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and admirably adapted\n      for a descent,) and the grapnel let go, which took firm hold at once. The\n      inhabitants of the island, and of the fort, thronged out, of course, to\n      see the balloon; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one\n      could be made to credit the actual voyage—<i>the crossing of the\n      Atlantic</i>. The grapnel caught at 2, P.M., precisely; and thus the whole\n      voyage was completed in seventy-five hours; or rather less, counting from\n      shore to shore. No serious accident occurred. No real danger was at any\n      time apprehended. The balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble;\n      and when the MS. from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from\n      Charleston, the party were still at Fort Moultrie. Their farther\n      intentions were not ascertained; but we can safely promise our readers\n      some additional information either on Monday or in the course of the next\n      day, at farthest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This is unquestionably the most stupendous, the most interesting, and the\n      most important undertaking, ever accomplished or even attempted by man.\n      What magnificent events may ensue, it would be useless now to think of\n      determining.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*1) <i>Note</i>.—Mr. Ainsworth has not attempted to account for\n      this phenomenon, which, however, is quite susceptible of explanation. A\n      line dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet, perpendicularly to the\n      surface of the earth (or sea), would form the perpendicular of a\n      right-angled triangle, of which the base would extend from the right angle\n      to the horizon, and the hypothenuse from the horizon to the balloon. But\n      the 25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing, in comparison with the\n      extent of the prospect. In other words, the base and hypothenuse of the\n      supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular,\n      that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel. In this manner the\n      horizon of the æronaut would appear to be <i>on a level</i> with\n      the car. But, as the point immediately beneath him seems, and is, at a\n      great distance below him, it seems, of course, also, at a great distance\n      below the horizon. Hence the impression of <i>concavity</i>; and this\n      impression must remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a\n      proportion to the extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the\n      base and hypothenuse disappears—when the earth’s real convexity must\n      become apparent.\n    </p>\n",

Ill usage and length\n      of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the other.\n      Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order, and a\n      contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores which early\n      study very diligently garnered up.—Beyond all things, the study of\n      the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised\n      admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my\n      habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities. I have often\n      been reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency of imagination\n      has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism of my opinions has\n      at all times rendered me notorious.

Upon the\n      whole, no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the\n      severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition. I have\n      thought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible tale I have to\n      tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination, than\n      the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been\n      a dead letter and a nullity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18— ,\n      from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on a\n      voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I went as passenger—having\n      no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me\n      as a fiend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons,\n      copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted\n      with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We had also on board\n      coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The stowage\n      was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood along\n      the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile the\n      monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small\n      grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular,\n      isolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as\n      from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia. I\n      watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to the\n      eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of\n      vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach. My notice was soon\n      afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the\n      peculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change,\n      and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I could\n      distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in\n      fifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with\n      spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. As night came\n      on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is impossible\n      to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least\n      perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb,\n      hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the\n      captain said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we were\n      drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the\n      anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew, consisting principally of\n      Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. I went below—not\n      without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed, every appearance warranted me\n      in apprehending a Simoom. I told the captain my fears; but he paid no\n      attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a reply. My\n      uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about midnight I went\n      upon deck. As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the\n      companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise, like that\n      occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could\n      ascertain its meaning, I found the ship quivering to its centre. In the\n      next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and,\n      rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation of\n      the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had gone by\n      the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, staggering\n      awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally righted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. Stunned by\n      the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between\n      the stern-post and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my feet, and\n      looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of our being\n      among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the\n      whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed.\n      After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us\n      at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to him with all my strength,\n      and presently he came reeling aft. We soon discovered that we were the\n      sole survivors of the accident. All on deck, with the exception of\n      ourselves, had been swept overboard;—the captain and mates must have\n      perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged with water. Without\n      assistance, we could expect to do little for the security of the ship, and\n      our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of\n      going down. Our cable had, of course, parted like pack-thread, at the\n      first breath of the hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously\n      overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea, and the\n      water made clear breaches over us. The frame-work of our stern was\n      shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received\n      considerable injury; but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked,\n      and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast. The main fury of\n      the blast had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from\n      the violence of the wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation\n      with dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered condition, we should\n      inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue. But this very\n      just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified. For five\n      entire days and nights—during which our only subsistence was a small\n      quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle—the\n      hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws\n      of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were\n      still more terrific than any tempest I had before encountered. Our course\n      for the first four days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and\n      we must have run down the coast of New Holland. On the fifth day the\n      cold became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to\n      the northward. The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and\n      clambered a very few degrees above the horizon—emitting no decisive\n      light. There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the\n      increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as nearly\n      as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of\n      the sun. It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen\n      glow without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. Just before\n      sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as if\n      hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim,\n      sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day—that day to me\n      has not yet arrived—to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward we\n      were enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an\n      object at twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to envelop\n      us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been\n      accustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that, although the tempest\n      continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be\n      discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto\n      attended us. All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black\n      sweltering desert of ebony. Superstitious terror crept by degrees\n      into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent\n      wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and\n      securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast,\n      looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had no means of\n      calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We were,\n      however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any\n      previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the\n      usual impediments of ice. In the meantime every moment threatened to be\n      our last—every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. The swell\n      surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly\n      buried is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and\n      reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but I could not help\n      feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself\n      gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an\n      hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black\n      stupendous seas became more dismally appalling. At times we gasped for\n      breath at an elevation beyond the albatross—at times became dizzy\n      with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew\n      stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my\n      companion broke fearfully upon the night. “See! see!” cried he, shrieking\n      in my ears, “Almighty God! see! see!” As he spoke, I became aware of a\n      dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast\n      chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting\n      my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood.\n      At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the\n      precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four thousand\n      tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred\n      times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the\n      line or East Indiaman in existence. Her huge hull was of a deep dingy\n      black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship. A single row\n      of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their\n      polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to\n      and fro about her rigging. But what mainly inspired us with horror and\n      astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth\n      of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane. When we\n      first discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly\n      from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her. For a moment of intense terror\n      she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own\n      sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and—came down.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my\n      spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin\n      that was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her\n      struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the\n      descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame\n      which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me,\n      with irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion\n      ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew. With little\n      difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was\n      partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the\n      hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An indefinite sense of awe, which at\n      first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was\n      perhaps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling to trust myself\n      with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken,\n      so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I therefore\n      thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I did by\n      removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner as to\n      afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me to\n      make use of it. A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and\n      unsteady gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of\n      observing his general appearance. There was about it an evidence of great\n      age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his\n      entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a low\n      broken tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and\n      groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments, and\n      decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild mixture of the\n      peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a God. He at\n      length went on deck, and I saw him no more.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul\n      —a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons\n      of bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will\n      offer me no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter\n      consideration is an evil. I shall never—I know that I shall never—be\n      satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions. Yet it is not\n      wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their\n      origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense—a new entity is\n      added to my soul.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the rays\n      of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus. Incomprehensible men!\n      Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pass me by\n      unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the people will not\n      see. It was but just now that I passed directly before the eyes of the\n      mate; it was no long while ago that I ventured into the captain’s own\n      private cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have\n      written. I shall from time to time continue this journal. It is true that\n      I may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will\n      not fall to make the endeavour. At the last moment I will enclose the MS.\n      in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation. Are\n      such things the operation of ungoverned chance? I had ventured upon deck\n      and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of\n      ratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl. While musing upon\n      the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the\n      edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel. The\n      studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of\n      the brush are spread out into the word D<small>ISCOVERY</small>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.\n      Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging,\n      build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind.\n      What she is not, I can easily perceive—what she is I fear it is\n      impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange\n      model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of\n      canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will\n      occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and\n      there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an\n      unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a material\n      to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character about the wood\n      which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has\n      been applied. I mean its extreme porousness, considered independently by\n      the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these\n      seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear\n      perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood would have\n      every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by any\n      unnatural means.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weather-beaten\n      Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection. “It is as sure,” he was\n      wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, “as sure as\n      there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living\n      body of the seaman.”\n     </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew.\n      They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the very\n      midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like the one\n      I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the marks of a\n      hoary old age. Their knees trembled with infirmity; their shoulders were\n      bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind;\n      their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their eyes glistened with the\n      rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest.\n      Around them, on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathematical\n      instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail. From that period\n      the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her terrific\n      course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon her, from her\n      trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every moment her\n      top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can\n      enter into the mind of a man to imagine. I have just left the deck, where\n      I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to\n      experience little inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle of miracles\n      that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever. We are\n      surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity, without\n      taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a thousand times more\n      stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the facility of\n      the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us\n      like demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple threats and\n      forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the\n      only natural cause which can account for such effect. I must suppose\n      the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or impetuous\n      under-tow.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin—but, as I\n      expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is, to\n      a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than\n      man, still, a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the\n      sensation of wonder with which I regarded him. In stature he is nearly my\n      own height; that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of a well-knit\n      and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably otherwise. But it\n      is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face—it\n      is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age, so\n      utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense—a\n      sentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear\n      upon it the stamp of a myriad of years. His gray hairs are records\n      of the past, and his grayer eyes are sibyls of the future. The cabin floor\n      was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering\n      instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts. His head was\n      bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery unquiet eye, over a\n      paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore the\n      signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself, as did the first seaman\n      whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue,\n      and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach\n      my ears from the distance of a mile.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The crew glide\n      to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager\n      and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the\n      wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before,\n      although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed\n      the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until\n      my very soul has become a ruin.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. If I\n      trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand\n      aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the\n      words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? All in the immediate\n      vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of\n      foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen,\n      indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away\n      into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current—if that appellation can\n      properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice,\n      thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of\n      a cataract.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible;\n      yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions,\n      predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the most\n      hideous aspect of death. It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to\n      some exciting knowledge—some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose\n      attainment is destruction. Perhaps this current leads us to the southern\n      pole itself. It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild\n      has every probability in its favor.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is upon\n      their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the\n      apathy of despair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd of\n      canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea! Oh,\n      horror upon horror!—the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left,\n      and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round and\n      round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is\n      lost in the darkness and the distance. But little time will be left me to\n      ponder upon my destiny! The circles rapidly grow small—we are\n      plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool—and amid a roaring,\n      and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship is\n      quivering—oh God! and—going down.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      NOTE.—The “MS. Found in a Bottle,” was originally published in 1831,\n      and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with\n      the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by\n      four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the\n      bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock,\n      towering to a prodigious height.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap11\"></a>THE OVAL PORTRAIT</h2>\n<p>\n      The château into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance,\n      rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a\n      night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and\n      grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact\n      than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been\n      temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one of\n      the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a\n      remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and\n      antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and\n      multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of\n      very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In\n      these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main\n      surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the\n      château rendered necessary—in these paintings my incipient delirium,\n      perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to\n      close the heavy shutters of the room—since it was already night—to\n      light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed, and\n      to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which\n      enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign\n      myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of\n      these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found\n      upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Long, long I read—and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and\n      gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of\n      the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty,\n      rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its\n      rays more fully upon the book.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of\n      the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the\n      room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the\n      bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It\n      was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced\n      at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not\n      at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained\n      thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an\n      impulsive movement to gain time for thought—to make sure that my\n      vision had not deceived me—to calm and subdue my fancy for a more\n      sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked fixedly\n      at the painting.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first\n      flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the\n      dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once\n      into waking life.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a mere\n      head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner;\n      much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom, and\n      even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet\n      deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval,\n      richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could\n      be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither\n      the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance,\n      which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it\n      have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the\n      head for that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of\n      the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly\n      dispelled such idea—must have prevented even its momentary\n      entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an\n      hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon\n      the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I\n      fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an\n      absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally\n      confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I\n      replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep\n      agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which\n      discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which\n      designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words\n      which follow:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee.\n      And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter. He,\n      passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she\n      a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; all\n      light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing\n      all things; hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the\n      pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of\n      the countenance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady\n      to hear the painter speak of his desire to portray even his young bride.\n      But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the\n      dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas\n      only from overhead. But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which\n      went on from hour to hour, and from day to day. And he was a passionate,\n      and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not\n      see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the\n      health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet\n      she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the\n      painter (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his\n      task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who\n      grew daily more dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the\n      portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and\n      a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her\n      whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew\n      nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for\n      the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes\n      from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he\n      would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn\n      from the cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks had\n      passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and\n      one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the\n      flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given, and\n      then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced\n      before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed,\n      he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud\n      voice, ‘This is indeed Life itself!’ turned suddenly to regard his\n      beloved:—She was dead!”\n     </p>\n"

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.1\"></a>THE DEVIL IN THE BELFRY</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n     What o’clock is it?—<i>Old Saying</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the world is—or,\n      alas, <i>was</i>—the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss. Yet as it lies\n      some distance from any of the main roads, being in a somewhat\n      out-of-the-way situation, there are perhaps very few of my readers who\n      have ever paid it a visit. For the benefit of those who have not,\n      therefore, it will be only proper that I should enter into some account of\n      it. And this is indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting\n      public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a\n      history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred within its\n      limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty thus self-imposed\n      will be executed to the best of my ability, with all that rigid\n      impartiality, all that cautious examination into facts, and diligent\n      collation of authorities, which should ever distinguish him who aspires to\n      the title of historian.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am enabled\n      to say, positively, that the borough of Vondervotteimittiss has existed,\n      from its origin, in precisely the same condition which it at present\n      preserves. Of the date of this origin, however, I grieve that I can only\n      speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians\n      are, at times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The\n      date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot\n      be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I confess myself,\n      with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude of opinions upon this\n      delicate point—some acute, some learned, some sufficiently the\n      reverse—I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered\n      satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg—nearly coincident with\n      that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder,\n      lege Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro\n      Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still countenanced by some\n      traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the\n      House of the Town-Council. I do not choose, however, to commit myself on a\n      theme of such importance, and must refer the reader desirous of\n      information to the “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz.\n      See, also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,\n      Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher; wherein\n      consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff, with the\n      Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the\n      foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name, there\n      can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always existed as we find\n      it at this epoch. The oldest man in the borough can remember not the\n      slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed,\n      the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult. The\n      site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of\n      a mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over\n      whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For this they\n      assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at\n      all on the other side.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved throughout\n      with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty little houses. These,\n      having their backs on the hills, must look, of course, to the centre of\n      the plain, which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling.\n      Every house has a small garden before it, with a circular path, a\n      sun-dial, and twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so\n      precisely alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the\n      other. Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is somewhat\n      odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque. They\n      are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks, red, with black ends, so that\n      the walls look like a chess-board upon a great scale. The gables are\n      turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all the rest of the\n      house, over the eaves and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and\n      deep, with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast\n      quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout, is of a\n      dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a trifling variety\n      of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of Vondervotteimittiss have\n      never been able to carve more than two objects—a time-piece and a\n      cabbage. But these they do exceedingly well, and intersperse them, with\n      singular ingenuity, wherever they find room for the chisel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture is all\n      upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs and tables of\n      black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet. The mantelpieces\n      are wide and high, and have not only time-pieces and cabbages sculptured\n      over the front, but a real time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking,\n      on the top in the middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing\n      on each extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the\n      time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach with a\n      great round hole in it, through which is seen the dial-plate of a watch.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking fire-dogs.\n      There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot over it, full of\n      sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of the house is always busy\n      in attending. She is a little fat old lady, with blue eyes and a red face,\n      and wears a huge cap like a sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow\n      ribbons. Her dress is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full\n      behind and very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other\n      respects, not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat\n      thick, and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings\n      to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each\n      with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In\n      her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right she wields\n      a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there stands a fat tabby\n      cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its tail, which “the boys” have\n      there fastened by way of a quiz.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden attending the\n      pig. They are each two feet in height. They have three-cornered cocked\n      hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to their thighs, buckskin\n      knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes with big silver buckles, long\n      surtout coats with large buttons of mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe\n      in his mouth, and a little dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff\n      and a look, and then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent\n      and lazy—is occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall\n      from the cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,\n      which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as\n      handsome as the cat.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed chair,\n      with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is seated the old man of\n      the house himself. He is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman, with\n      big circular eyes and a huge double chin. His dress resembles that of the\n      boys—and I need say nothing farther about it. All the difference is,\n      that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater\n      smoke. Like them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket.\n      To say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch to\n      attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits with\n      his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always\n      keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable\n      object in the centre of the plain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town Council.\n      The Town Council are all very little, round, oily, intelligent men, with\n      big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and have their coats much longer and\n      their shoe-buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of\n      Vondervotteimittiss. Since my sojourn in the borough, they have had\n      several special meetings, and have adopted these three important\n      resolutions:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:” and—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the steeple\n      is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of mind, the pride\n      and wonder of the village—the great clock of the borough of\n      Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which the eyes of the old\n      gentlemen are turned who sit in the leather-bottomed arm-chairs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of\n      the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its\n      faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There is a\n      belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most\n      perfect of sinecures—for the clock of Vondervotteimittis was never\n      yet known to have anything the matter with it. Until lately, the bare\n      supposition of such a thing was considered heretical. From the remotest\n      period of antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have\n      been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was just the\n      same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough. Never was such\n      a place for keeping the true time. When the large clapper thought proper\n      to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its obedient followers opened their throats\n      simultaneously, and responded like a very echo. In short, the good\n      burghers were fond of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their\n      clocks.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less respect, and\n      as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the most perfect of\n      sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world. He\n      is the chief dignitary of the borough, and the very pigs look up to him\n      with a sentiment of reverence. His coat-tail is very far longer—his\n      pipe, his shoe-buckles, his eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than\n      those of any other old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is\n      not only double, but triple.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss: alas, that so\n      fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that “no good\n      can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that the words had in\n      them something of the spirit of prophecy. It wanted five minutes of noon,\n      on the day before yesterday, when there appeared a very odd-looking object\n      on the summit of the ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course,\n      attracted universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a\n      leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of dismay\n      upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the clock in the\n      steeple.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll object in\n      question was perceived to be a very diminutive foreign-looking young man.\n      He descended the hills at a great rate, so that every body had soon a good\n      look at him. He was really the most finicky little personage that had ever\n      been seen in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark\n      snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an\n      excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of displaying, as\n      he was grinning from ear to ear. What with mustachios and whiskers, there\n      was none of the rest of his face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and\n      his hair neatly done up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting\n      swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length\n      of white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings,\n      and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for\n      bows. Under one arm he carried a huge <i>chapeau-de-bras</i>, and under the other\n      a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold\n      snuff-box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of\n      fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest\n      possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a sight for the\n      honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an audacious\n      and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right into the village, the\n      old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion; and many a\n      burgher who beheld him that day would have given a trifle for a peep\n      beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the\n      pocket of his swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous\n      indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a fandango\n      here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the remotest idea in the\n      world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to get\n      their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a minute of noon,\n      the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the midst of them; gave a <i>chassez</i>\n      here, and a <i>balancez</i> there; and then, after a <i>pirouette</i> and a\n      <i>pas-de-zephyr</i>, pigeon-winged himself right up into the belfry of the House\n      of the Town Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a\n      state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at once by the\n      nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big <i>chapeau-de-bras</i> upon his\n      head; knocked it down over his eyes and mouth; and then, lifting up the\n      big fiddle, beat him with it so long and so soundly, that what with the\n      belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have\n      sworn that there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the\n      devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of Vondervotteimittiss.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled\n      attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for the important fact that\n      it now wanted only half a second of noon. The bell was about to strike,\n      and it was a matter of absolute and pre-eminent necessity that every body\n      should look well at his watch. It was evident, however, that just at this\n      moment the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no\n      business to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had\n      any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count the\n      strokes of the bell as it sounded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “One!” said the clock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every leather-bottomed\n      arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said his watch also; “von!” said\n      the watch of his vrow; and “von!” said the watches of the boys, and the\n      little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Two!” continued the big bell; and\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the others.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Eleven!” said the big one.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Eleben!” assented the little ones.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Twelve!” said the bell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their voices.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up their\n      watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thirteen!” said he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale, dropping\n      their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from over their left\n      knees.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is\n      Dirteen o’clock!!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All\n      Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been ongry\n      for dis hour!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has been done to\n      rags for this hour!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen, “Donder\n      and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and they filled\n      them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in their arm-chairs,\n      puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was immediately\n      filled with impenetrable smoke.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it seemed as if\n      old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing in the shape of a\n      timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if\n      bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces could scarcely contain\n      themselves for fury, and kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and\n      such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to\n      see. But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any\n      longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails, and\n      resented it by scampering all over the place, scratching and poking, and\n      squeaking and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and flying into\n      the faces, and running under the petticoats of the people, and creating\n      altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for\n      a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters still more\n      distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the steeple was evidently\n      exerting himself to the utmost. Every now and then one might catch a\n      glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke. There he sat in the belfry\n      upon the belfry-man, who was lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the\n      villain held the bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head,\n      raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On his\n      lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all time and\n      tune, with both hands, making a great show, the nincompoop! of playing\n      “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in disgust, and\n      now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and fine kraut. Let us\n      proceed in a body to the borough, and restore the ancient order of things\n      in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting that little fellow from the steeple.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.2\"></a>LIONIZING</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n     —— all people went<br>\n     Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—<i>Bishop Hall’s Satires</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the\n      author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe, is\n      Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of Fum-Fudge.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with both\n      hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father wept for joy\n      and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I mastered before I was\n      breeched.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to understand\n      that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous, he might, by\n      merely following it, arrive at a Lionship. But my attention was not\n      confined to theories alone. Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of\n      pulls and swallowed a half dozen of drams.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step with him\n      into his study.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of your\n      existence?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a nose?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been variously\n      defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I pulled out my\n      watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall have time enough to\n      get through with them all before midnight. To commence then:—The\n      nose, according to Bartholinus, is that protuberance—that bump—that\n      excrescence—that—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am thunderstruck\n      at the extent of your information—I am positively—upon my\n      soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon his heart.] “Come\n      here!” [Here he took me by the arm.] “Your education may now be considered\n      as finished—it is high time you should scuffle for yourself—and\n      you cannot do a better thing than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—”\n      [Here he kicked me downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of\n      my house, and God bless you!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this accident rather\n      fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided by the paternal advice.\n      I determined to follow my nose. I gave it a pull or two upon the spot, and\n      wrote a pamphlet on Nosology forthwith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Great man!” said Bentley.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Divine soul!” said Fraser.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “One of us!” said Blackwood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these\n      people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an\n      artist.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the Marquis of\n      So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of This-and-That was\n      flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness of Touch-me-Not was\n      leaning upon the back of her chair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I approached the artist and turned up my nose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I do,” said I, blowing it well.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a microscope.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “None,” said I, turning it up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of\n      the manœuvre.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds?” said he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Precisely,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A thousand pounds?” said he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Just so,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he drew me a\n      check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I engaged rooms in\n      Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the ninety-ninth edition of the\n      “Nosology,” with a portrait of the proboscis.—That sad little rake,\n      the Prince of Wales, invited me to dinner.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were all lions and <i>recherchés</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus, Plotinus,\n      Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price, Priestly,\n      Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill Health.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were\n      philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms; bi-part\n      and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive intelligence and\n      homoömeria.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus; heresy\n      and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism; Homousios and\n      Homouioisios.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned Muriton of\n      red tongue; cauliflowers with <i>velouté</i> sauce; veal <i>à la St</i>. Menehoult;\n      marinade <i>à la</i> St. Florentin; and orange jellies <i>en mosaïques</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and Markbrünnen; upon\n      Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St. George; upon Haubrion,\n      Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne,\n      upon Lafitte, and upon St. Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot,\n      and told, with his eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and\n      Amontillado.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of Cimabué,\n      Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of Caravaggio, of the\n      amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of the frows of Rubens, and of\n      the waggeries of Jan Steen.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of opinion\n      that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in Egypt, Dian in\n      Rome, and Artemis in Greece.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking that the\n      angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in the sixth heaven\n      had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth was supported by a\n      sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of green horns.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the\n      eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four orations of\n      Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches of Lysias; of the\n      hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus; of the eighth book of the\n      conic sections of Apollonius; of Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of\n      the five and forty tragedies of Homer Junior.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all about\n      internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms, fluidiforms, and\n      solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist and schorl; about gypsum\n      and trap; about talc and calc; about blende and horn-blende; about\n      mica-slate and pudding-stone; about cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite\n      and tremolite; about antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever\n      you please.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of\n      myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up my\n      nose, and I spoke of myself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of\n      Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me under the\n      chin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Upon honor,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nose and all?” she asked.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As I live,” I replied.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two, and found\n      myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to suffocation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He is coming!” said somebody farther up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He is coming!” said somebody farther still.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little love!”—and,\n      seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice upon the nose. A\n      marked sensation immediately ensued.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Diavolo!</i>” cried Count Capricornutti.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Dios guarda!</i>” muttered Don Stiletto.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Mille tonnerres!</i>” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Tousand teufel!</i>” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon Bluddennuff.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “<i>Donner und Blitzen!</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At Chalk-Farm, the\n      next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called upon my friends.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Bête!</i>” said the first.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Fool!” said the second.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Dolt!” said the third.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ass!” said the fourth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ninny!” said the fifth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Noodle!” said the sixth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Be off!” said the seventh.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in hitting\n      the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark. You have a fine\n      nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none. You are damned, and he\n      has become the hero of the day. I grant you that in Fum-Fudge the\n      greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis—but,\n      good heavens! there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at\n      all.”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.3\"></a> X-ING A PARAGRAB</h2>\n<p>\n      As it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the East,’ and as Mr.\n      Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows that Mr.\n      Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter be\n      needed, here we have it—Mr. B. was an editor. Irascibility was his\n      sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of which men accused him was\n      anything but his foible, since he justly considered it his forte. It was\n      his strong point—his virtue; and it would have required all the\n      logic of a Brownson to convince him that it was ‘anything else.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and the only\n      occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when, abandoning that\n      legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he migrated to the city of\n      Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some place of a similar title, out West.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up his mind\n      finally to settle in that town, it was under the impression that no\n      newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed in that particular section\n      of the country. In establishing ‘The Tea-Pot’ he expected to have the\n      field all to himself. I feel confident he never would have dreamed of\n      taking up his residence in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware\n      that, in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John\n      Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there quietly grown\n      fat in editing and publishing the ‘Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.’\n      It was solely, therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr.\n      Bullet-head found himself in Alex—— suppose we call it Nopolis, ‘for short’—but,\n      as he did find himself there, he determined to keep up his character for\n      obst—for firmness, and remain. So remain he did; and he did more; he\n      unpacked his press, type, etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to\n      that of the ‘Gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued\n      the first number of ‘The Alexan’—that is to say, of ‘The Nopolis\n      Tea-Pot’—as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the new\n      paper.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant—not to say severe.\n      It was especially bitter about things in general—and as for the\n      editor of ‘The Gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in particular. Some of\n      Bullet-head’s remarks were really so fiery that I have always, since that\n      time, been forced to look upon John Smith, who is still alive, in the\n      light of a salamander. I cannot pretend to give all the ‘Tea-Pot’s’\n      paragraphs verbatim, but one of them runs thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Oh, yes!—Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way is\n      a genius—O, my! Oh, goodness, gracious!—what is this world\n      coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a bombshell\n      among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups of excited\n      individuals gathered at the corners of the streets. Every one awaited,\n      with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the dignified Smith. Next morning it\n      appeared as follows:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘We quote from “The Tea-Pot” of yesterday the subjoined paragraph: “Oh,\n      yes! Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh, goodness! Oh, tempora! Oh,\n      Moses!” Why, the fellow is all O! That accounts for his reasoning in a\n      circle, and explains why there is neither beginning nor end to him, nor to\n      anything he says. We really do not believe the vagabond can write a word\n      that hasn’t an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by,\n      he came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O’s as much\n      there as he does here? “O! it is pitiful.”’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous insinuations, I\n      shall not attempt to describe. On the eel-skinning principle, however, he\n      did not seem to be so much incensed at the attack upon his integrity as\n      one might have imagined. It was the sneer at his style that drove him to\n      desperation. What!—he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!—not able to\n      write a word without an O in it! He would soon let the jackanapes see that\n      he was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see how much he was mistaken, the\n      puppy! He, Touch-and-go Bullet-head, of Frogpondium, would let Mr. John\n      Smith perceive that he, Bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a\n      whole paragraph—aye! a whole article—in which that\n      contemptible vowel should not once—not even once—make its\n      appearance. But no;—that would be yielding a point to the said John\n      Smith. He, Bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the\n      caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom. Perish so vile a thought! The O\n      forever; He would persist in the O. He would be as O-wy as O-wy could be.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great Touch-and-go,\n      in the next ‘Tea-Pot,’ came out merely with this simple but resolute\n      paragraph, in reference to this unhappy affair:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘The editor of the “Tea-Pot” has the honor of advising the editor of the\n      “Gazette” that he (the “Tea-Pot”) will take an opportunity in tomorrow\n      morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “Gazette”) that he (the “Tea-Pot”)\n      both can and will be <i>his own master</i>, as regards style;—he (the “Tea-Pot”)\n      intending to show him (the “Gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the\n      withering contempt with which the criticism of him (the “Gazette”)\n      inspires the independent bosom of him (the “Tea-Pot”) by composing for the\n      especial gratification (?) of him (the “Gazette”) a leading article, of\n      some extent, in which the beautiful vowel—the emblem of Eternity—yet\n      so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of him (the “Gazette”) shall\n      most certainly not be avoided by his (the “Gazette’s”) most obedient,\n      humble servant, the “Tea-Pot.” “So much for Buckingham!”’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather than\n      decidedly enunciated, the great Bullet-head, turning a deaf ear to all\n      entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his foreman to ‘go to the d——l,’\n      when he (the foreman) assured him (the ‘Tea-Pot’!) that it was high time\n      to ‘go to press’: turning a deaf ear to everything, I say, the great\n      Bullet-head sat up until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and\n      absorbed in the composition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which\n      follows:—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘So ho, John! how now? Told you so, you know. Don’t crow, another time,\n      before you’re out of the woods! Does your mother know you’re out? Oh, no,\n      no!—so go home at once, now, John, to your odious old woods of\n      Concord! Go home to your woods, old owl—go! You won’t! Oh, poh, poh, John\n      don’t do so! You’ve <i>got</i> to go, you know! So go at once, and don’t go slow,\n      for nobody owns you here, you know! Oh! John, John, if you don’t go you’re\n      no homo—no! You’re only a fowl, an owl; a cow, a sow; a doll,\n      a poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or frog,\n      come out of a Concord bog. Cool, now—cool! Do be cool, you fool!\n      None of your crowing, old cock! Don’t frown so—don’t! Don’t hollo,\n      nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! Good Lord, John, how you do look!\n      Told you so, you know—but stop rolling your goose of an old poll\n      about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great\n      Touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. Firmly,\n      composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his MS. to the\n      devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home, retired, with\n      ineffable dignity to bed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs to his\n      ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a commencement at\n      ‘setting’ the MS. ‘up.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the first place, of course,—as the opening word was ‘So,’—he\n      made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph with a\n      capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw himself upon the\n      little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity—but who shall describe his\n      horror when his fingers came up without the anticipated letter in their\n      clutch? who shall paint his astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he\n      rubbed his knuckles, that he had been only thumping them to no purpose,\n      against the bottom of an empty box. Not a single little-o was in the\n      little-o hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-O partition, he\n      found <i>that</i>, to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar predicament. Awe-stricken,\n      his first impulse was to rush to the foreman.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘I can’t never set up nothing without\n      no o’s.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘What do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a very ill\n      humor at being kept so late.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a little\n      un!’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘What—what the d—l has become of all that were in the case?’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘I don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “G’zette” devils\n      is bin prowling ’bout here all night, and I spect he’s gone and cabbaged\n      ‘em every one.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Dod rot him! I haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman, getting\n      purple with rage ‘but I tell you what you do, Bob, that’s a good boy—you\n      go over the first chance you get and hook every one of their i’s and (d——n\n      them!) their izzards.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Jist so,’ replied Bob, with a wink and a frown—‘I’ll be into ‘em,\n      I’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that ere paragrab?\n      Mus go in to-night, you know—else there’ll be the d—l to pay, and—’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘And not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a deep sigh,\n      and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘Is it a long paragraph, Bob?’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Shouldn’t call it a <i>wery</i> long paragrab,’ said Bob.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to press,’ said\n      the foreman, who was over head and ears in work; ‘just stick in some other\n      letter for o; nobody’s going to read the fellow’s trash anyhow.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Wery well,’ replied Bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to his case,\n      muttering as he went: ‘Considdeble vell, them ere expressions, perticcler\n      for a man as doesn’t swar. So I’s to gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n\n      all their gizzards! Vell! this here’s the chap as is just able for to do\n      it.’ The fact is that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet\n      high, he was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in\n      printing-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but the fact is\n      indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it almost always happens\n      that x is adopted as a substitute for the letter deficient. The true\n      reason, perhaps, is that x is rather the most superabundant letter in the\n      cases, or at least was so in the old times—long enough to render the\n      substitution in question an habitual thing with printers. As for Bob, he\n      would have considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a\n      case of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘I shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he read it\n      over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest o-wy paragrab I\n      ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and to press it went x-ed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Next morning the population of Nopolis were taken all aback by reading in\n      ‘The Tea-Pot,’ the following extraordinary leader:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Sx hx, Jxhn! hxw nxw?

The first definite idea entertained by the populace was,\n      that some diabolical treason lay concealed in the hieroglyphics; and there\n      was a general rush to Bullet-head’s residence, for the purpose of riding\n      him on a rail; but that gentleman was nowhere to be found. He had\n      vanished, no one could tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever\n      been seen since.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at length\n      subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a medley of opinion\n      about this unhappy affair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberance of fancy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A third admitted him X-entric, but no more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee’s design to X-press, in a\n      general way, his X-asperation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to all; and in\n      fact, since that editor could not be found, there was some talk about\n      lynching the other one.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was, simply,\n      X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town mathematician confessed\n      that he could make nothing of so dark a problem. X, everybody knew, was\n      an unknown quantity; but in this case (as he properly observed), there was\n      an unknown quantity of X.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having ‘X-ed the\n      paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as I think it deserved,\n      although it was very openly and very fearlessly expressed. He said that,\n      for his part, he had no doubt about the matter at all, that it was a clear\n      case, that Mr. Bullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like\n      other folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed XXX ale,\n      and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage, and made him\n      X (cross) in the X-treme.’\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.4\"></a>METZENGERSTEIN</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n     Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—<i>Martin Luther</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why then give a\n      date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to say, that at the\n      period of which I speak, there existed, in the interior of Hungary, a\n      settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of\n      the doctrines themselves—that is, of their falsity, or of their\n      probability—I say nothing. I assert, however, that much of our\n      incredulity—as La Bruyère says of all our unhappiness—“<i>vient\n      de ne pouvoir être seuls</i>.” {*1}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which were fast\n      verging to absurdity. They—the Hungarians—differed very\n      essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, “<i>The soul</i>,”\n       said the former—I give the words of an acute and intelligent\n      Parisian—“<i>ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps sensible: au\n      reste—un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que la ressemblance\n      peu tangible de ces animaux.</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at variance for\n      centuries. Never before were two houses so illustrious, mutually\n      embittered by hostility so deadly. The origin of this enmity seems to be\n      found in the words of an ancient prophecy—“A lofty name shall have a\n      fearful fall when, as the rider over his horse, the mortality of\n      Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But more trivial\n      causes have given rise—and that no long while ago—to\n      consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were\n      contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy\n      government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom friends; and the\n      inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might look, from their lofty\n      buttresses, into the very windows of the palace Metzengerstein. Least of\n      all had the more than feudal magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to\n      allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy\n      Berlifitzings. What wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that\n      prediction, should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two\n      families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary\n      jealousy? The prophecy seemed to imply—if it implied anything—a\n      final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house; and was of\n      course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less\n      influential.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at the epoch\n      of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man, remarkable for nothing\n      but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his\n      rival, and so passionate a love of horses, and of hunting, that neither\n      bodily infirmity, great age, nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily\n      participation in the dangers of the chase.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet of age.\n      His father, the Minister G—, died young. His mother, the Lady Mary,\n      followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that time, in his fifteenth\n      year. In a city, fifteen years are no long period—a child may be\n      still a child in his third lustrum: but in a wilderness—in so\n      magnificent a wilderness as that old principality, fifteen years have a\n      far deeper meaning.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his\n      father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former, entered immediately\n      upon his vast possessions. Such estates were seldom held before by a\n      nobleman of Hungary. His castles were without number. The chief in point\n      of splendor and extent was the “Château Metzengerstein.” The boundary line\n      of his dominions was never clearly defined; but his principal park\n      embraced a circuit of fifty miles.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so well\n      known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was afloat in\n      regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed, for the space of\n      three days, the behavior of the heir out-Heroded Herod, and fairly\n      surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers. Shameful\n      debaucheries—flagrant treacheries—unheard-of atrocities—gave\n      his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on\n      their part—no punctilios of conscience on his own—were\n      thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a\n      petty Caligula. On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle\n      Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous opinion of\n      the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous\n      list of the Baron’s misdemeanors and enormities.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young nobleman\n      himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast and desolate upper\n      apartment of the family palace of Metzengerstein. The rich although faded\n      tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the\n      shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. <i>Here</i>,\n      rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly seated with\n      the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the wishes of a temporal\n      king, or restrained with the fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious\n      sceptre of the Arch-enemy. <i>There</i>, the dark, tall statures of the\n      Princes Metzengerstein—their muscular war-coursers plunging over the\n      carcasses of fallen foes—startled the steadiest nerves with their\n      vigorous expression; and <i>here</i>, again, the voluptuous and swan-like\n      figures of the dames of days gone by, floated away in the mazes of an\n      unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the gradually\n      increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing—or perhaps pondered\n      upon some more novel, some more decided act of audacity—his eyes\n      became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous, and unnaturally\n      colored horse, represented in the tapestry as belonging to a Saracen\n      ancestor of the family of his rival. The horse itself, in the foreground\n      of the design, stood motionless and statue-like—while farther back,\n      its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On Frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became aware of the\n      direction which his glance had, without his consciousness, assumed. Yet he\n      did not remove it. On the contrary, he could by no means account for the\n      overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses.\n      It was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent\n      feelings with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed the more\n      absorbing became the spell—the more impossible did it appear that he\n      could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry. But\n      the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent, with a compulsory\n      exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full\n      by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned mechanically to\n      the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment, the head of the gigantic\n      steed had, in the meantime, altered its position. The neck of the animal,\n      before arched, as if in compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord,\n      was now extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The eyes,\n      before invisible, now wore an energetic and human expression, while they\n      gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and the distended lips of the\n      apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting\n      teeth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door. As he\n      threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the chamber, flung\n      his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry, and he\n      shuddered to perceive that shadow—as he staggered awhile upon the\n      threshold—assuming the exact position, and precisely filling up the\n      contour, of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the Saracen\n      Berlifitzing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into the open\n      air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered three equerries.\n      With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril of their lives, they were\n      restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and fiery-colored horse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Whose horse? Where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a querulous\n      and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware that the mysterious\n      steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of the furious\n      animal before his eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries, “at least\n      he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying, all smoking and\n      foaming with rage, from the burning stables of the Castle Berlifitzing.\n      Supposing him to have belonged to the old Count’s stud of foreign horses,\n      we led him back as an estray. But the grooms there disclaim any title to\n      the creature; which is strange, since he bears evident marks of having\n      made a narrow escape from the flames.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his forehead,”\n       interrupted a second equerry, “I supposed them, of course, to be the\n      initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing—but all at the castle are\n      positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Extremely singular!” said the young Baron, with a musing air, and\n      apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “He is, as you say, a\n      remarkable horse—a prodigious horse! although, as you very justly\n      observe, of a suspicious and untractable character; let him be mine,\n      however,” he added, after a pause, “perhaps a rider like Frederick of\n      Metzengerstein, may tame even the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned, is <i>not</i>\n      from the stables of the Count. If such had been the case, we know our duty\n      better than to bring him into the presence of a noble of your family.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “True!” observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of the\n      bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and a precipitate\n      step. He whispered into his master’s ear an account of the sudden\n      disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry, in an apartment which he\n      designated; entering, at the same time, into particulars of a minute and\n      circumstantial character; but from the low tone of voice in which these\n      latter were communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity\n      of the equerries.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a variety\n      of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure, and an expression\n      of determined malignancy settled upon his countenance, as he gave\n      peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately locked up,\n      and the key placed in his own possession.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter Berlifitzing?” said\n      one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after the departure of the page, the\n      huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own, plunged and\n      curvetted, with redoubled fury, down the long avenue which extended from\n      the château to the stables of Metzengerstein.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No!” said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead! say\n      you?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will be, I\n      imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “How died he?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud,\n      he has himself perished miserably in the flames.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and deliberately\n      impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Indeed;” repeated the vassal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the château.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor of\n      the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von Metzengerstein. Indeed, his\n      behavior disappointed every expectation, and proved little in accordance\n      with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner,\n      still less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the\n      neighboring aristocracy. He was never to be seen beyond the limits of his\n      own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was utterly companionless—unless,\n      indeed, that unnatural, impetuous, and fiery-colored horse, which he\n      henceforward continually bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title\n      of his friend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time,\n      however, periodically came in. “Will the Baron honor our festivals with\n      his presence?” “Will the Baron join us in a hunting of the boar?”—“Metzengerstein\n      does not hunt;” “Metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and\n      laconic answers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility.\n      Such invitations became less cordial—less frequent—in time\n      they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count Berlifitzing\n      was even heard to express a hope “that the Baron might be at home when he\n      did not wish to be at home, since he disdained the company of his equals;\n      and ride when he did not wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a\n      horse.” This to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique;\n      and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become,\n      when we desire to be unusually energetic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the conduct of\n      the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of\n      his parents—forgetting, however, his atrocious and reckless behavior\n      during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some\n      there were, indeed, who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence\n      and dignity. Others again (among them may be mentioned the family\n      physician) did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and\n      hereditary ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were\n      current among the multitude.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired charger—an\n      attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of\n      the animal’s ferocious and demon-like propensities—at length became,\n      in the eyes of all reasonable men, a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the\n      glare of noon—at the dead hour of night—in sickness or in\n      health—in calm or in tempest—the young Metzengerstein seemed\n      rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse, whose intractable\n      audacities so well accorded with his own spirit.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late events, gave\n      an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider, and to\n      the capabilities of the steed. The space passed over in a single leap had\n      been accurately measured, and was found to exceed, by an astounding\n      difference, the wildest expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron,\n      besides, had no particular <i>name</i> for the animal, although all the\n      rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations.\n      His stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with\n      regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the owner in\n      person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the enclosure of that\n      particular stall. It was also to be observed, that although the three\n      grooms, who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration at\n      Berlifitzing, had succeeded in arresting his course, by means of a\n      chain-bridle and noose—yet no one of the three could with any\n      certainty affirm that he had, during that dangerous struggle, or at any\n      period thereafter, actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast.\n      Instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and\n      high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting\n      unreasonable attention—especially among men who, daily trained to\n      the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of\n      a horse—but there were certain circumstances which intruded\n      themselves per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic; and it is\n      said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood\n      around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his\n      terrible stamp—times when the young Metzengerstein turned pale and\n      shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression of his earnest and\n      human-looking eye.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to doubt the\n      ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of the\n      young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse; at least, none but an\n      insignificant and misshapen little page, whose deformities were in\n      everybody’s way, and whose opinions were of the least possible importance.\n      He—if his ideas are worth mentioning at all—had the effrontery\n      to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an\n      unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return\n      from every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of triumphant\n      malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy slumber,\n      descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting in hot haste,\n      bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An occurrence so common\n      attracted no particular attention, but his return was looked for with\n      intense anxiety on the part of his domestics, when, after some hours’\n      absence, the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the Chateau\n      Metzengerstein, were discovered crackling and rocking to their very\n      foundation, under the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable\n      fire.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a progress\n      that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently\n      futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent and\n      pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful object soon rivetted the attention\n      of the multitude, and proved how much more intense is the excitement\n      wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony,\n      than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate\n      matter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main\n      entrance of the Château Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an unbonneted and\n      disordered rider, was seen leaping with an impetuosity which outstripped\n      the very Demon of the Tempest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,\n      uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive struggle of\n      his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but no sound, save a\n      solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated lips, which were bitten\n      through and through in the intensity of terror. One instant, and the\n      clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the\n      flames and the shrieking of the winds—another, and, clearing at a\n      single plunge the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the\n      tottering staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid\n      the whirlwind of chaotic fire.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm sullenly\n      succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud, and,\n      streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere, shot forth a glare of\n      preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the\n      battlements in the distinct colossal figure of—<i>a horse</i>.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.5\"></a>THE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER</h2>\n<p>\n      During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme\n      southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles of a\n      certain <i>Maison de Santé</i> or private mad-house, about which I had heard much,\n      in Paris, from my medical friends. As I had never visited a place of the\n      kind, I thought the opportunity too good to be lost; and so proposed to my\n      travelling companion (a gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance\n      a few days before), that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look\n      through the establishment. To this he objected—pleading haste in the\n      first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the sight of a\n      lunatic. He begged me, however, not to let any mere courtesy towards\n      himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity, and said that he\n      would ride on leisurely, so that I might overtake him during the day, or,\n      at all events, during the next. As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me\n      that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises,\n      and mentioned my fears on this point. He replied that, in fact, unless I\n      had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur Maillard, or some\n      credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty might be found to exist,\n      as the regulations of these private mad-houses were more rigid than the\n      public hospital laws. For himself, he added, he had, some years since,\n      made the acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride\n      up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the subject of\n      lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a grass-grown\n      by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself in a dense forest,\n      clothing the base of a mountain. Through this dank and gloomy wood we rode\n      some two miles, when the <i>Maison de Santé</i> came in view. It was a fantastic\n      château, much dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and\n      neglect. Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and, checking my\n      horse, I half resolved to turn back. I soon, however, grew ashamed of my\n      weakness, and proceeded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and the\n      visage of a man peering through. In an instant afterward, this man came\n      forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him cordially by the hand, and\n      begged him to alight. It was Monsieur Maillard himself. He was a portly,\n      fine-looking gentleman of the old school, with a polished manner, and a\n      certain air of gravity, dignity, and authority which was very impressive.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect the\n      establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance that he would\n      show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw him no more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and\n      exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of refined\n      taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical instruments. A\n      cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. At a piano, singing an aria from\n      Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful woman, who, at my entrance, paused\n      in her song, and received me with graceful courtesy. Her voice was low,\n      and her whole manner subdued. I thought, too, that I perceived the traces\n      of sorrow in her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste,\n      not unpleasingly, pale. She was attired in deep mourning, and excited in\n      my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and admiration.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard was\n      managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of soothing”—that\n      all punishments were avoided—that even confinement was seldom\n      resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched, were left\n      much apparent liberty, and that most of them were permitted to roam about\n      the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said before\n      the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane; and, in fact,\n      there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me\n      to imagine she was not. I confined my remarks, therefore, to general\n      topics, and to such as I thought would not be displeasing or exciting even\n      to a lunatic. She replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I\n      said; and even her original observations were marked with the soundest\n      good sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had\n      taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I continued to\n      practise, throughout the interview, the caution with which I commenced it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit, wine,\n      and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon afterward\n      leaving the room. As she departed I turned my eyes in an inquiring manner\n      toward my host.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a\n      most accomplished woman.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of course\n      you will know how to excuse me. The excellent administration of your\n      affairs here is well understood in Paris, and I thought it just possible,\n      you know—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank\n      you for the commendable prudence you have displayed. We seldom find so\n      much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some unhappy\n      contre-temps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of\n      our visitors. While my former system was in operation, and my patients\n      were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were\n      often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to\n      inspect the house. Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system of\n      exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion\n      I could not rely.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating his words—“do\n      I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing system’ of which I have\n      heard so much is no longer in force?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded to\n      renounce it forever.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Indeed! you astonish me!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary to return\n      to the old usages. The danger of the soothing system was, at all times,\n      appalling; and its advantages have been much overrated. I believe, sir,\n      that in this house it has been given a fair trial, if ever in any. We did\n      every thing that rational humanity could suggest. I am sorry that you\n      could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have\n      judged for yourself. But I presume you are conversant with the soothing\n      practice—with its details.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Not altogether. What I have heard has been at third or fourth hand.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which the\n      patients were <i>menagés</i>—humored. We contradicted no fancies which entered\n      the brains of the mad. On the contrary, we not only indulged but\n      encouraged them; and many of our most permanent cures have been thus\n      effected. There is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the\n      madman as the argumentum ad absurdum. We have had men, for example, who\n      fancied themselves chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a\n      fact—to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently\n      perceiving it to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for\n      a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken. In this manner a\n      little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But was this species of acquiescence all?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “By no means. We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind, such as\n      music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards, certain classes of\n      books, and so forth. We affected to treat each individual as if for some\n      ordinary physical disorder; and the word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. A\n      great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the\n      others. To repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a\n      madman, is to gain him body and soul. In this way we were enabled to\n      dispense with an expensive body of keepers.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And you had no punishments of any kind?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “None.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And you never confined your patients?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Very rarely. Now and then, the malady of some individual growing to a\n      crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to a secret cell,\n      lest his disorder should infect the rest, and there kept him until we\n      could dismiss him to his friends—for with the raging maniac we have\n      nothing to do. He is usually removed to the public hospitals.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Decidedly. The system had its disadvantages, and even its dangers. It is\n      now, happily, exploded throughout all the <i>Maisons de Santé</i> of France.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I made sure\n      that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for mania existed in\n      any portion of the country.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time will arrive\n      when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the\n      world, without trusting to the gossip of others. Believe nothing you hear,\n      and only one-half that you see. Now about our <i>Maisons de Santé</i>, it is\n      clear that some ignoramus has misled you. After dinner, however, when you\n      have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy\n      to take you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my\n      opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation, is\n      incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in\n      some measure.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or two,\n      during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. To a\n      sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such\n      exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner. We will\n      dine. I can give you some veal a la Menehoult, with cauliflowers in\n      <i>velouté</i> sauce—after that a glass of Clos de Vougeot—then your\n      nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a large <i>salle\n      à manger</i>, where a very numerous company were assembled—twenty-five\n      or thirty in all. They were, apparently, people of rank—certainly of high\n      breeding—although their habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly\n      rich, partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the <i>vielle\n      cour</i>. I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were ladies; and\n      some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a Parisian would\n      consider good taste at the present day. Many females, for example, whose\n      age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion\n      of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms\n      and arms shamefully bare. I observed, too, that very few of the dresses\n      were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the\n      wearers. In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to whom\n      Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but my surprise\n      was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale, with high-heeled\n      shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much too large for her that it\n      gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression. When I had first seen\n      her, she was attired, most becomingly, in deep mourning. There was an air\n      of oddity, in short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first,\n      caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,” and to\n      fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive me until after\n      dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the\n      repast, at finding myself dining with lunatics; but I remembered having\n      been informed, in Paris, that the southern provincialists were a\n      peculiarly eccentric people, with a vast number of antiquated notions; and\n      then, too, upon conversing with several members of the company, my\n      apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of\n      good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about it. For example,\n      the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a carpet is frequently\n      dispensed with. The windows, too, were without curtains; the shutters,\n      being shut, were securely fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally,\n      after the fashion of our ordinary shop-shutters. The apartment, I\n      observed, formed, in itself, a wing of the château, and thus the windows\n      were on three sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other.\n      There were no less than ten windows in all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The table was superbly set out. It was loaded with plate, and more than\n      loaded with delicacies. The profusion was absolutely barbaric. There were\n      meats enough to have feasted the Anakim. Never, in all my life, had I\n      witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of\n      life. There seemed very little taste, however, in the arrangements; and my\n      eyes, accustomed to quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious\n      glare of a multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were\n      deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was possible\n      to find a place. There were several active servants in attendance; and,\n      upon a large table, at the farther end of the apartment, were seated seven\n      or eight people with fiddles, fifes, trombones, and a drum. These fellows\n      annoyed me very much, at intervals, during the repast, by an infinite\n      variety of noises, which were intended for music, and which appeared to\n      afford much entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of the\n      bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up of all\n      kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts of conventional\n      customs. I had travelled, too, so much, as to be quite an adept at the nil\n      admirari; so I took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host, and,\n      having an excellent appetite, did justice to the good cheer set before me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. The ladies,\n      as usual, talked a great deal. I soon found that nearly all the company\n      were well educated; and my host was a world of good-humored anecdote in\n      himself. He seemed quite willing to speak of his position as\n      superintendent of a<i>Maison de Santé</i>; and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was,\n      much to my surprise, a favorite one with all present. A great many amusing\n      stories were told, having reference to the <i>whims</i> of the patients.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat at my\n      right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the way, is\n      it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered\n      the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely an insane asylum in France\n      which cannot supply a human tea-pot. Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware\n      tea-pot, and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and\n      whiting.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long ago, a\n      person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey—which\n      allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite true. He was a troublesome\n      patient; and we had much ado to keep him within bounds. For a long time he\n      would eat nothing but thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by\n      insisting upon his eating nothing else. Then he was perpetually kicking\n      out his heels—so—so—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here interrupted an\n      old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “Please keep your feet to yourself!\n      You have spoiled my brocade! Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark\n      in so practical a style? Our friend here can surely comprehend you without\n      all this. Upon my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor\n      unfortunate imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle!” replied Monsieur De Kock, thus addressed—“a\n      thousand pardons! I had no intention of offending. Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur\n      De Kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much ceremony, and\n      took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing myself, “allow\n      me to send you a morsel of this veal <i>à la St. Menehoult</i>—you will find\n      it particularly fine.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing\n      safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher, containing what I\n      supposed to be the “<i>monstrum, horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen\n      ademptum</i>.” A closer scrutiny assured me, however, that it was only a small\n      calf roasted whole, and set upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as\n      is the English fashion of dressing a hare.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not particularly\n      partial to veal <i>à la St</i>.—what is it?—for I do not find that it\n      altogether agrees with me. I will change my plate, however, and try some\n      of the rabbit.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what appeared to\n      be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious morceau, which I can\n      recommend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and give him a\n      side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “This what?” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This rabbit <i>au-chat</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no. I will just help myself to\n      some of the ham.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the tables of\n      these people of the province. I will have none of their rabbit <i>au-chat</i>—and,\n      for the matter of that, none of their <i>cat-au-rabbit</i> either.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of the\n      table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken\n      off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a patient, once upon a\n      time, who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a Cordova cheese,\n      and went about, with a knife in his hand, soliciting his friends to try a\n      small slice from the middle of his leg.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but not to be\n      compared with a certain individual whom we all know, with the exception of\n      this strange gentleman. I mean the man who took himself for a bottle of\n      champagne, and always went off with a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb in his\n      left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork, and\n      then, by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth, created a\n      sharp hissing and fizzing, which lasted for several minutes, in imitation\n      of the frothing of champagne. This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very\n      pleasing to Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the\n      conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself for a\n      frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree. I wish you\n      could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed myself—“it\n      would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on.\n      Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only observe that it is a pity he\n      was not. His croak thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest\n      note in the world—B flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table\n      thus—after taking a glass or two of wine—and distended his\n      mouth, thus, and rolled up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive\n      rapidity, thus, why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively,\n      that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have no doubt of it,” I said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And then,” said somebody else, “then there was Petit Gaillard, who\n      thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed because he\n      could not take himself between his own finger and thumb.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And then there was Jules Desoulières, who was a very singular genius,\n      indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin. He persecuted\n      the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the cook indignantly\n      refused to do. For my part, I am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie <i>à la\n      Desoulières</i> would not have been very capital eating indeed!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You astonish me!” said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur\n      Maillard.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman—“he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho!\n      ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—very good indeed! You must not be\n      astonished, <i>mon ami;</i> our friend here is a wit—a <i>drôle</i>—you must\n      not understand him to the letter.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And then,” said some other one of the party,—“then there was\n      Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way. He grew\n      deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two heads. One of\n      these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the other he imagined a\n      composite one, being Demosthenes’ from the top of the forehead to the\n      mouth, and Lord Brougham’s from the mouth to the chin. It is not\n      impossible that he was wrong; but he would have convinced you of his being\n      in the right; for he was a man of great eloquence. He had an absolute\n      passion for oratory, and could not refrain from display. For example, he\n      used to leap upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his shoulder\n      and whispered a few words in his ear; upon which he ceased talking with\n      great suddenness, and sank back within his chair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was Boullard, the\n      tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in fact, he was seized with\n      the droll, but not altogether irrational, crotchet, that he had been\n      converted into a tee-totum. You would have roared with laughter to see him\n      spin. He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this manner—so—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper, performed an\n      exactly similar office for himself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice,\n      “your Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at\n      best; for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum? The\n      thing is absurd. Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person, as you know.\n      She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common sense, and gave\n      pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance. She found, upon\n      mature deliberation, that, by some accident, she had been turned into a\n      chicken-cock; but, as such, she behaved with propriety. She flapped her\n      wings with prodigious effect—so—so—so—and, as for\n      her crow, it was delicious!\n      Cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-de-doo\n      dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!” here interrupted\n      our host, very angrily. “You can either conduct yourself as a lady should\n      do, or you can quit the table forthwith—take your choice.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame Joyeuse,\n      after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just given) blushed up to\n      the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof. She hung down\n      her head, and said not a syllable in reply. But another and younger lady\n      resumed the theme. It was my beautiful girl of the little parlor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was really much\n      sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugénie Salsafette. She was a\n      very beautiful and painfully modest young lady, who thought the ordinary\n      mode of habiliment indecent, and wished to dress herself, always, by\n      getting outside instead of inside of her clothes. It is a thing very\n      easily done, after all. You have only to do so—and then so—so—so—and\n      then so—so—so—and then so—so—and then—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mon dieu! Ma’m’selle Salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at once.\n      “What are you about?—forbear!—that is sufficient!—we\n      see, very plainly, how it is done!—hold! hold!” and several persons\n      were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma’m’selle Salsafette\n      from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean Venus, when the point\n      was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud\n      screams, or yells, from some portion of the main body of the <i>château</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but the rest of\n      the company I really pitied. I never saw any set of reasonable people so\n      thoroughly frightened in my life. They all grew as pale as so many\n      corpses, and, shrinking within their seats, sat quivering and gibbering\n      with terror, and listening for a repetition of the sound. It came again—louder\n      and seemingly nearer—and then a third time very loud, and then a\n      fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished. At this apparent dying away\n      of the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained, and\n      all was life and anecdote as before. I now ventured to inquire the cause\n      of the disturbance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A mere <i>bagatelle</i>,” said Monsieur Maillard. “We are used to these things,\n      and care really very little about them. The lunatics, every now and then,\n      get up a howl in concert; one starting another, as is sometimes the case\n      with a bevy of dogs at night. It occasionally happens, however, that the\n      <i>concerto</i> yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose;\n      when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And how many have you in charge?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “At present we have not more than ten, altogether.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Principally females, I presume?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, no—every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell\n      you.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Indeed! I have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of\n      the gentler sex.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is generally so, but not always. Some time ago, there were about\n      twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less than eighteen\n      were women; but, lately, matters have changed very much, as you see.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes—have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the\n      gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma’m’selle Laplace.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes—have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole\n      company at once.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great rage.\n      Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute.\n      As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to the letter, and thrusting\n      out her tongue, which was an excessively long one, held it very\n      resignedly, with both hands, until the end of the entertainment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And this gentlewoman,” said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending over and\n      addressing him in a whisper—“this good lady who has just spoken, and\n      who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo—she, I presume, is harmless—quite\n      harmless, eh?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why—why, what can\n      you mean?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Only slightly touched?” said I, touching my head. “I take it for granted\n      that she is not particularly not dangerously affected, eh?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Mon dieu!</i> what is it you imagine? This lady, my particular old friend\n      Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself. She has her little\n      eccentricities, to be sure—but then, you know, all old women—all\n      <i>very</i> old women—are more or less eccentric!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure—and then the rest of these\n      ladies and gentlemen—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Are my friends and keepers,” interupted Monsieur Maillard, drawing\n      himself up with <i>hauteur</i>,—“my very good friends and assistants.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What! all of them?” I asked,—“the women and all?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Assuredly,” he said,—“we could not do at all without the women;\n      they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of their\n      own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous effect—something\n      like the fascination of the snake, you know.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure! They behave a little odd, eh?—they\n      are a little queer, eh?—don’t you think so?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Odd!—queer!—why, do you really think so? We are not very\n      prudish, to be sure, here in the South—do pretty much as we please—enjoy\n      life, and all that sort of thing, you know—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you know—a\n      little strong—you understand, eh?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure. By the bye, Monsieur, did I\n      understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place of the\n      celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous severity?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “By no means. Our confinement is necessarily close; but the treatment—the\n      medical treatment, I mean—is rather agreeable to the patients than\n      otherwise.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And the new system is one of your own invention?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Not altogether. Some portions of it are referable to Professor Tarr, of\n      whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are modifications in\n      my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the\n      celebrated Fether, with whom, if I mistake not, you have the honor of an\n      intimate acquaintance.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am quite ashamed to confess,” I replied, “that I have never even heard\n      the names of either gentleman before.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair abruptly, and\n      uplifting his hands. “I surely do not hear you aright! You did not intend\n      to say, eh? that you had never heard either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or\n      of the celebrated Professor Fether?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” I replied; “but the truth\n      should be held inviolate above all things. Nevertheless, I feel humbled to\n      the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of these, no doubt,\n      extraordinary men. I will seek out their writings forthwith, and peruse\n      them with deliberate care. Monsieur Maillard, you have really—I must\n      confess it—you have really—made me ashamed of myself!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And this was the fact.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my hand,—“join\n      me now in a glass of Sauterne.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      We drank. The company followed our example without stint. They chatted—they\n      jested—they laughed—they perpetrated a thousand absurdities—the\n      fiddles shrieked—the drum row-de-dowed—the trombones bellowed\n      like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris—and the whole scene, growing\n      gradually worse and worse, as the wines gained the ascendancy, became at\n      length a sort of pandemonium in petto. In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard\n      and myself, with some bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us,\n      continued our conversation at the top of the voice. A word spoken in an\n      ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish\n      from the bottom of Niagara Falls.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And, sir,” said I, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned something before\n      dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing. How is\n      that?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger indeed.\n      There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and, in my opinion as\n      well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether, it is never safe to\n      permit them to run at large unattended. A lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it\n      is called, for a time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become\n      obstreperous. His cunning, too, is proverbial and great. If he has a\n      project in view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the\n      dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the\n      metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of mind.\n      When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high time to put him\n      in a straitjacket.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your own\n      experience—during your control of this house—have you had\n      practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes. For example:—no\n      very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this very house.\n      The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in operation, and the patients\n      were at large. They behaved remarkably well—especially so—any one of\n      sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that\n      particular fact, that the fellows behaved so remarkably well. And, sure\n      enough, one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and\n      foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if they were\n      the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had usurped the offices of\n      the keepers.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my life!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a\n      lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he had\n      invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before—of\n      lunatic government, I mean. He wished to give his invention a trial, I\n      suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a\n      conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And he really succeeded?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No doubt of it. The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places.\n      Not that exactly either—for the madmen had been free, but the\n      keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am sorry to say,\n      in a very cavalier manner.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected. This condition of\n      things could not have long existed. The country people in the\n      neighborhood—visitors coming to see the establishment—would have\n      given the alarm.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “There you are out. The head rebel was too cunning for that. He admitted\n      no visitors at all—with the exception, one day, of a very\n      stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid. He\n      let him in to see the place—just by way of variety,—to have a\n      little fun with him. As soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently, he let\n      him out, and sent him about his business.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And how long, then, did the madmen reign?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, a very long time, indeed—a month certainly—how much\n      longer I can’t precisely say. In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly\n      season of it—that you may swear. They doffed their own shabby\n      clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels. The cellars of\n      the château were well stocked with wine; and these madmen are just the\n      devils that know how to drink it. They lived well, I can tell you.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And the treatment—what was the particular species of treatment\n      which the leader of the rebels put into operation?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have already\n      observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better\n      treatment than that which it superseded. It was a very capital system\n      indeed—simple—neat—no trouble at all—in fact it\n      was delicious—it was—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of yells, of\n      the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us. This\n      time, however, they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Gracious heavens!” I ejaculated—“the lunatics have most undoubtedly\n      broken loose.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I very much fear it is so,” replied Monsieur Maillard, now becoming\n      excessively pale. He had scarcely finished the sentence, before loud\n      shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows; and, immediately\n      afterward, it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to\n      gain entrance into the room. The door was beaten with what appeared to be\n      a sledge-hammer, and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious\n      violence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued. Monsieur Maillard, to my\n      excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board. I had expected\n      more resolution at his hands. The members of the orchestra, who, for the\n      last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty,\n      now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments, and,\n      scrambling upon their table, broke out, with one accord, into, “Yankee\n      Doodle,” which they performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an\n      energy superhuman, during the whole of the uproar.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and glasses,\n      leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been restrained from\n      leaping there before. As soon as he fairly settled himself, he commenced\n      an oration, which, no doubt, was a very capital one, if it could only have\n      been heard. At the same moment, the man with the teetotum predilection,\n      set himself to spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and\n      with arms outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all\n      the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that happened\n      to get in his way. And now, too, hearing an incredible popping and fizzing\n      of champagne, I discovered at length, that it proceeded from the person\n      who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner. And then,\n      again, the frog-man croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended\n      upon every note that he uttered. And, in the midst of all this, the\n      continuous braying of a donkey arose over all. As for my old friend,\n      Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor lady, she appeared\n      so terribly perplexed. All she did, however, was to stand up in a corner,\n      by the fireplace, and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice,\n      “Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And now came the climax—the catastrophe of the drama. As no\n      resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was offered\n      to the encroachments of the party without, the ten windows were very\n      speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in. But I shall never forget\n      the emotions of wonder and horror with which I gazed, when, leaping\n      through these windows, and down among us <i>pêle-mêle</i>, fighting, stamping,\n      scratching, and howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be\n      chimpanzees, ourang-outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of Good\n      Hope.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I received a terrible beating—after which I rolled under a sofa and\n      lay still. After lying there some fifteen minutes, during which time I\n      listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room, I came to same\n      satisfactory <i>dénouement</i> of this tragedy. Monsieur Maillard, it appeared,\n      in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to\n      rebellion, had been merely relating his own exploits. This gentleman had,\n      indeed, some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the\n      establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient. This fact\n      was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me. The keepers,\n      ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered, were first well tarred,\n      then carefully feathered, and then shut up in underground cells.\n      They had been so imprisoned for more than a month, during which period\n      Monsieur Maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and\n      feathers (which constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of\n      water. The latter was pumped on them daily. At length, one escaping\n      through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been resumed at\n      the <i>château;</i> yet I cannot help agreeing with Monsieur Maillard, that his\n      own “treatment” was a very capital one of its kind. As he justly observed,\n      it was “simple—neat—and gave no trouble at all—not the\n      least.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I have only to add that, although I have searched every library in Europe\n      for the works of Doctor <i>Tarr</i> and Professor <i>Fether</i>, I have, up to the\n      present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.6\"></a>THE LITERARY LIFE OF THINGUM BOB, ESQ.</h2>\n<h3>LATE EDITOR OF THE “GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.”<br>\nBy Himself</h3>\n<p>\n      I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that Shakespeare\n      and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not impossible that I may even\n      die. It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as well retire from the\n      field of Letters and repose upon my laurels. But I am ambitious of\n      signalizing my abdication of the literary sceptre by some important\n      bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I cannot do a better thing than just\n      pen for it an account of my earlier career. My name, indeed, has been so\n      long and so constantly before the public eye, that I am not only willing\n      to admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere excited,\n      but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has inspired. In fact,\n      it is no more than the duty of him who achieves greatness to leave behind\n      him, in his ascent, such landmarks as may guide others to be great. I\n      propose, therefore, in the present paper, (which I had some idea of\n      calling “Memoranda to serve for the Literary History of America,”) to give\n      a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first steps, by\n      which, at length, I attained the high road to the pinnacle of human\n      renown.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much. My father,\n      Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of his profession,\n      which was that of a merchant-barber, in the city of Smug. His warehouse\n      was the resort of all the principal people of the place, and especially of\n      the editorial corps—a body which inspires all about it with profound\n      veneration and awe. For my own part, I regarded them as gods, and drank in\n      with avidity the rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their\n      august mouths during the process of what is styled “lather.” My first\n      moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that ever-memorable\n      epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the “Gad-Fly,” in the intervals of\n      the important process just mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of\n      our apprentices, an inimitable poem in honor of the “Only Genuine\n      Oil-of-Bob,” (so called from its talented inventor, my father,) and for\n      which effusion the editor of the “Fly” was remunerated with a regal\n      liberality by the firm of Thomas Bob &amp; company, merchant-barbers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The genius of the stanzas to the “Oil-of-Bob” first breathed into me, I\n      say, the divine <i>afflatus</i>. I resolved at once to become a great man,\n      and to commence by becoming a great poet. That very evening I fell upon my\n      knees at the feet of my father.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Father,” I said, “pardon me!—but I have a soul above lather. It is\n      my firm intention to cut the shop. I would be an editor—I would be a\n      poet—I would pen stanzas to the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’ Pardon me and aid me\n      to be great!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My dear Thingum,” replied my father, (I had been christened Thingum after\n      a wealthy relative so surnamed,) “My dear Thingum,” he said, raising me\n      from my knees by the ears—“Thingum, my boy, you’re a trump, and take\n      after your father in having a soul. You have an immense head, too, and it\n      must hold a great many brains. This I have long seen, and therefore had\n      thoughts of making you a lawyer. The business, however, has grown\n      ungenteel, and that of a politician don’t pay. Upon the whole you judge\n      wisely;—the trade of editor is best:—and if you can be a poet\n      at the same time,—as most of the editors are, by the by,—why\n      you will kill two birds with one stone. To encourage you in the beginning\n      of things, I will allow you a garret; pen, ink, and paper; a rhyming\n      dictionary; and a copy of the ‘Gad-Fly.’ I suppose you would scarcely\n      demand any more.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I would be an ungrateful villain if I did,” I replied with enthusiasm.\n      “Your generosity is boundless. I will repay it by making you the father of\n      a genius.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately upon its\n      termination, I betook myself with zeal to my poetical labors; as upon\n      these, chiefly, I founded my hopes of ultimate elevation to the editorial\n      chair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to “The\n      Oil-of-Bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise. Their splendor more dazzled\n      than enlightened me. The contemplation of their excellence tended,\n      naturally, to discourage me by comparison with my own abortions; so that\n      for a long time I labored in vain. At length there came into my head one\n      of those exquisitely original ideas which now and then <i>will</i>\n      permeate the brain of a man of genius. It was this:—or, rather, thus\n      was it carried into execution. From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a\n      very remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and\n      altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them to me\n      for a song. From one of these, which purported to be a translation of one\n      Dante’s “Inferno,” I copied with remarkable neatness a long passage about\n      a man named Ugolino, who had a parcel of brats. From another which\n      contained a good many old plays by some person whose name I forget, I\n      extracted in the same manner, and with the same care, a great number of\n      lines about “angels” and “ministers saying grace,” and “goblins damned,”\n       and more besides of that sort. From a third, which was the composition of\n      some blind man or other, either a Greek or a Choctaw—I cannot be at\n      the pains of remembering every trifle exactly—I took about fifty\n      verses beginning with “Achilles’ wrath,” and “grease,” and something else.\n      From a fourth, which I recollect was also the work of a blind man, I\n      selected a page or two all about “hail” and “holy light”; and although a\n      blind man has no business to write about light, still the verses were\n      sufficiently good in their way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having made fair copies of these poems, I signed every one of them\n      “Oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing each up nicely in a\n      separate envelope, I despatched one to each of the four principal\n      Magazines, with a request for speedy insertion and prompt pay. The result\n      of this well conceived plan, however, (the success of which would have\n      saved me much trouble in after life,) served to convince me that some\n      editors are not to be bamboozled, and gave the <i>coup-de-grace</i> (as\n      they say in France,) to my nascent hopes, (as they say in the city of the\n      transcendentals.)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in question, gave\n      Mr. “Oppodeldoc” a complete using-up, in the “Monthly Notices to\n      Correspondents.” The “Hum-Drum” gave him a dressing after this fashion:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long <i>tirade</i>\n      concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘Ugolino,’ who had a great many\n      children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed without their\n      suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame—not to say <i>flat</i>.\n      ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid of imagination—and\n      imagination, in our humble opinion, is not only the soul of Poesy, but\n      also its very heart. ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has the audacity to\n      demand of us, for his twattle, a ‘speedy insertion and prompt pay.’ We\n      neither insert nor purchase any stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt,\n      however, that he would meet with a ready sale for all the balderdash he\n      can scribble, at the office of either the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or\n      the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon “Oppodeldoc”—but\n      the unkindest cut was putting the word Poesy in small caps. In those five\n      pre-eminent letters what a world of bitterness is there not involved!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But “Oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in the “Rowdy-Dow,”\n       which spoke thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We have received a most singular and insolent communication from a person\n      (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘Oppodeldoc’—thus desecrating the\n      greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so named. Accompanying the\n      letter of ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) we find sundry lines of most\n      disgusting and unmeaning rant about ‘angels and ministers of grace’—rant\n      such as no madman short of a Nat Lee, or an ‘Oppodeldoc,’ could possibly\n      perpetrate. And for this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘pay\n      promptly.’ No sir—no! We pay for nothing of <i>that</i> sort. Apply\n      to the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’ These <i>periodicals</i>\n      will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may send them—and as\n      undoubtedly <i>promise</i> to pay for it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This was bitter indeed upon poor “Oppodeldoc”; but, in this instance, the\n      weight of the satire falls upon the “Hum-drum,” the “Lollipop,” and the\n      “Goosetherumfoodle,” who are pungently styled “<i>periodicals</i>”—in\n      Italics, too—a thing that must have cut them to the heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Scarcely less savage was the “Lollipop,” which thus discoursed:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Some <i>individual</i>, who rejoices in the appellation ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (to\n      what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often applied!)\n      has enclosed us some fifty or sixty <i>verses</i> commencing after this\n      fashion:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring<br>\n      Of woes unnumbered, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that there is not\n      a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the daily habit of composing\n      better <i>lines</i>. Those of ‘Oppodeldoc’ will not <i>scan</i>.\n      ‘Oppodeldoc’ should learn to <i>count</i>. But why he should have\n      conceived the idea that <i>we</i>, (of all others, <i>we!</i>) would\n      disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly beyond\n      comprehension. Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good enough for the\n      ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’—things that are\n      in the practice of publishing ‘Mother Goose’s Melodies’ as original\n      lyrics. And ‘Oppodeldoc’ (whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand\n      <i>pay</i> for this drivel. Does ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) know—is\n      he aware that we could not be paid to insert it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller and smaller, and\n      when I came to the point at which the editor sneered at the poem as\n      “verses” there was little more than an ounce of me left. As for\n      “Oppodeldoc,” I began to experience <i>compassion</i> for the poor fellow.\n      But the “Goosetherumfoodle” showed, if possible, less mercy than the\n      “Lollipop.” It was the “Goosetherumfoodle” that said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘Oppodeldoc,’ is silly enough to\n      fancy that <i>we</i> will print and <i>pay for</i> a medley of incoherent\n      and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to us, and which\n      commences with the following most <i>intelligible</i> line:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      ‘Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We say, ‘most <i>intelligible</i>.’ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) will be\n      kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘<i>hail</i>’ can be ‘<i>holy light</i>’\n      We always regarded it as <i>frozen rain</i>. Will he inform us, also, how\n      frozen rain can be, at one and the same time, both ‘holy light,’ (whatever\n      that is,) and an ‘offspring?’—which latter term, (if we understand\n      any thing about English,) is only employed, with propriety, in reference\n      to small babies of about six weeks old. But it is preposterous to descant\n      upon such absurdity—although ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has the\n      unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only ‘insert’ his\n      ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) <i>pay for them!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      “Now this is fine—it is rich!—and we have half a mind to\n      punish this young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his\n      effusion, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, as he has written it. We could\n      inflict no punishment so severe, and we <i>would</i> inflict it, but for\n      the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) send any future <i>composition</i> of\n      like character to the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ <i>They</i>\n      will ‘insert’ it. <i>They</i> ‘insert’ every month just such stuff. Send\n      it to them. WE are not to be insulted with impunity.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This made an end of me; and as for the “Hum-Drum,” the “Rowdy-Dow,” and the\n      “Lollipop,” I never could comprehend how they survived it. The putting <i>them</i>\n      in the smallest possible <i>minion</i>, (that was the rub—thereby\n      insinuating their lowness—their baseness,) while WE stood looking\n      down upon them in gigantic capitals!—oh it was <i>too</i> bitter!—it\n      was wormwood—it was gall. Had I been either of these periodicals I\n      would have spared no pains to have the “Goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted. It\n      might have been done under the Act for the “Prevention of Cruelty to\n      Animals.” As for “Oppodeldoc,” (whoever he was), I had by this time lost\n      all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him no longer. He was a\n      fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,) and got not a kick more than he\n      deserved.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The result of my experiment with the old books, convinced me, in the first\n      place, that “honesty is the best policy,” and, in the second, that if I\n      could not write better than Mr. Dante, and the two blind men, and the rest\n      of the old set, it would, at least, be a difficult matter to write worse.\n      I took heart, therefore, and determined to prosecute the “entirely\n      original,” (as they say on the covers of the magazines,) at whatever cost\n      of study and pains. I again placed before my eyes, as a model, the\n      brilliant stanzas on “The Oil-of-Bob” by the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” and\n      resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme, in rivalry of what\n      had already been done.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With my first verse I had no material difficulty. It ran thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      “To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate rhymes to “Bob,”\n       I found it impossible to proceed. In this dilemma I had recourse to\n      paternal aid; and, after some hours of mature thought, my father and\n      myself thus constructed the poem:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n<i>“To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob’<br>\n      Is all sorts of a job.</i><br>\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“(Signed) Snob.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To be sure, this composition was of no very great length—but I “have\n      yet to learn” as they say in the Edinburgh Review, that the mere extent of\n      a literary work has any thing to do with its merit. As for the Quarterly\n      cant about “sustained effort,” it is impossible to see the sense of it.\n      Upon the whole, therefore, I was satisfied with the success of my maiden\n      attempt, and now the only question regarded the disposal I should make of\n      it. My father suggested that I should send it to the “Gad-Fly”—but\n      there were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing. I\n      dreaded the jealousy of the editor—and I had ascertained that he did\n      not pay for original contributions. I therefore, after due deliberation,\n      consigned the article to the more dignified pages of the “Lollipop,” and\n      awaited the event in anxiety, but with resignation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the very next published number I had the proud satisfaction of seeing\n      my poem printed at length, as the leading article, with the following\n      significant words, prefixed in italics and between brackets:\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>We call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable stanza\n      on “The Oil of Bob.” We need say nothing of their sublimity, or their\n      pathos:—it is impossible to peruse them without tears. Those who\n      have been nauseated with a sad dose on the same august topic from the\n      goose quill of the editor of the “Gad Fly” will do well to compare the two\n      compositions.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      P. S.—We are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which envelops the\n      evident pseudonym “Snob.” May we hope for a personal interview?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, I confess, rather\n      more than I had expected:—I acknowledged this, be it observed, to\n      the everlasting disgrace of my country and of mankind. I lost no time,\n      however, in calling upon the editor of the “Lollipop,” and had the good\n      fortune to find this gentleman at home. He saluted me with an air of\n      profound respect, slightly blended with a fatherly and patronizing\n      admiration, wrought in him, no doubt, by my appearance of extreme youth\n      and inexperience. Begging me to be seated, he entered at once upon the\n      subject of my poem;—but modesty will ever forbid me to repeat the\n      thousand compliments which he lavished upon me. The eulogies of Mr. Crab,\n      (such was the editor’s name,) were, however, by no means fulsomely\n      indiscriminate. He analyzed my composition with much freedom and great\n      ability—not hesitating to point out a few trivial defects—a\n      circumstance which elevated him highly in my esteem. The “Gad-Fly” was, of\n      course, brought upon the <i>tapis</i>, and I hope never to be subjected to\n      a criticism so searching, or to rebukes so withering, as were bestowed by\n      Mr. Crab upon that unhappy effusion. I had been accustomed to regard the\n      editor of the “Gad-Fly” as something superhuman; but Mr. Crab soon\n      disabused me of that idea. He set the literary as well as the personal\n      character of the Fly (so Mr. C. satirically designated the rival editor,)\n      in its true light. He, the Fly, was very little better than he should be.\n      He had written infamous things. He was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. He\n      was a villain. He had composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a\n      guffaw, and a farce which deluged the universe in tears. Besides all this,\n      he had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon himself, (Mr.\n      Crab,) and the temerity to style him “an ass.” Should I at any time wish\n      to express my opinion of Mr. Fry, the pages of the “Lollipop,” Mr. Crab\n      assured me, were at my unlimited disposal. In the meantime, as it was very\n      certain that I would be attacked in the Fly for my attempt at composing a\n      rival poem on the “Oil-of-Bob,” he (Mr. Crab,) would take it upon himself\n      to attend, pointedly, to my private and personal interests. If I were not\n      made a man of at once, it should not be the fault of himself, (Mr. Crab.)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter portion of which\n      I found it impossible to comprehend,) I ventured to suggest something\n      about the remuneration which I had been taught to expect for my poem, by\n      an announcement on the cover of the “Lollipop,” declaring that it, (the\n      “Lollipop,”) “insisted upon being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for\n      all accepted contributions—frequently expending more money for a\n      single brief poem than the whole annual cost of the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ combined.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As I mentioned the word “remuneration,” Mr. Crab first opened his eyes,\n      and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable extent; causing his personal\n      appearance to resemble that of a highly-agitated elderly duck in the act\n      of quacking; and in this condition he remained, (ever and anon\n      pressing his hands tightly to his forehead, as if in a state of desperate\n      bewilderment) until I had nearly made an end of what I had to say.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if much overcome,\n      letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side, but keeping his mouth still\n      rigorously open, after the fashion of the duck. While I remained in\n      speechless astonishment at behavior so alarming, he suddenly leaped to his\n      feet and made a rush at the bell-rope; but just as he reached this, he\n      appeared to have altered his intention, whatever it was, for he dived\n      under a table and immediately re-appeared with a cudgel. This he was in\n      the act of uplifting, (for what purpose I am at a loss to imagine,) when,\n      all at once, there came a benign smile over his features, and he sank\n      placidly back in his chair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mr. Bob,” he said, (for I had sent up my card before ascending myself,)\n      “Mr. Bob, you are a young man, I presume—<i>very?</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I assented; adding that I had not yet concluded my third lustrum.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah!” he replied, “very good! I see how it is—say no more! Touching\n      this matter of compensation, what you observe is very just: in fact it is\n      excessively so. But ah—ah—the <i>first</i> contribution—the\n      <i>first</i>, I say,—it is never the Magazine custom to pay for—you\n      comprehend, eh? The truth is, we are usually the <i>recipients</i> in such\n      case.” [Mr. Crab smiled blandly as he emphasized the word “recipients.”]\n      “For the most part, we are <i>paid</i> for the insertion of a maiden\n      attempt—especially in verse. In the second place, Mr. Bob, the\n      Magazine rule is never to disburse what we term in France the <i>argent\n      comptant</i>—I have no doubt you understand. In a quarter or two\n      after publication of the article—or in a year or two—we make\n      no objection to giving our note at nine months; provided always that\n      we can so arrange our affairs as to be quite certain of a ‘burst up’ in\n      six. I really <i>do</i> hope, Mr. Bob, that you will look upon this\n      explanation as satisfactory.” Here Mr. Crab concluded, and the tears stood\n      in his eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently, the cause of pain\n      to so eminent and so sensitive a man, I hastened to apologize, and to\n      reassure him, by expressing my perfect coincidence with his views, as well\n      as my entire appreciation of the delicacy of his position. Having done all\n      this in a neat speech, I took leave.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One fine morning, very shortly afterwards, “I awoke and found myself\n      famous.” The extent of my renown will be best estimated by reference to\n      the editorial opinions of the day. These opinions, it will be seen, were\n      embodied in critical notices of the number of the “Lollipop” containing my\n      poem, and are perfectly satisfactory, conclusive and clear with the\n      exception, perhaps, of the hieroglyphical marks, “<i>Sep</i>. 15—1\n      t.” appended to each of the critiques.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The “Owl,” a journal of profound sagacity, and well known for the\n      deliberate gravity of its literary decisions—the “Owl,” I say, spoke\n      as follows:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘The Lollipop!’ The October number of this delicious Magazine\n      surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance. In the\n      beauty of its typography and paper—in the number and excellence of\n      its steel plates—as well as in the literary merit of its\n      contributions—the ‘Lollipop’ compares with its slow-paced rivals as\n      Hyperion with a Satyr. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the\n      ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ excel, it is true, in braggadocio, but, in all other\n      points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this celebrated journal can sustain\n      its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand. To be\n      sure, it has a circulation of 100,000, and its subscription-list has\n      increased one-fourth during the last month; but, on the other hand, the\n      sums it disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable. It is\n      reported that Mr. Slyass received no less than thirty-seven and a half\n      cents for his inimitable paper on ‘Pigs.’ With Mr. Crab, as editor, and\n      with such names upon the list of contributors as Snob and Slyass, there\n      can be no such word as ‘fail’ for the Lollipop.’ Go and subscribe. <i>Sep</i>. 15—1\n      <i>t.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      I must say that I was gratified with this high-toned notice from a paper\n      so respectable as the “Owl.” The placing my name—that is to say, my\n      <i>nom de guerre</i>—in priority of station to that of the great\n      Slyass, was a compliment as happy as I felt it to be deserved.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the “Toad”—a\n      print highly distinguished for its uprightness, and independence—for\n      its entire freedom from sycophancy and subservience to the givers of\n      dinners:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The ‘Lollipop’ for October is out in advance of all its\n      contemporaries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the splendor\n      of its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its literary\n      contents. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’\n      excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all other points, give us the\n      ‘Lollipop. How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its evidently\n      tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand. To be sure, it has a\n      circulation of 200,000, and its subscription list has increased one-third\n      during the last fortnight, but on the other hand, the sums it disburses,\n      monthly, for contributions, are fearfully great. We learn that Mr.\n      Mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late ‘Monody in a\n      Mud-Puddle.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Among the original contributors to the present number we notice, (besides\n      the eminent editor, Mr. Crab,) such men as Snob, Slyass, and Mumblethumb.\n      Apart from the editorial matter, the most valuable paper, nevertheless,\n      is, we think, a poetical gem by Snob, on the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—but our\n      readers must not suppose from the title of this incomparable <i>bijou</i>,\n      that it bears any similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a\n      certain contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears\n      polite. The present poem ‘On the Oil-of-Bob,’ has excited universal\n      anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the evident pseudonym,\n      ‘Snob’—a curiosity which, happily, we have it in our power to\n      satisfy. ‘Snob’ is the nom de plume of Mr. Thingum Bob, of this city,—a\n      relative of the great Mr. Thingum, (after whom he is named,) and otherwise\n      connected with the most illustrious families of the State. His father,\n      Thomas Bob, Esq., is an opulent merchant in Smug. <i>Sep</i>. 15—1 <i>t.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      This generous approbation touched me to the heart—the more\n      especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly—so proverbially\n      pure as the “Toad.” The word “balderdash,” as applied to the “Oil-of-Bob”\n       of the Fly, I considered singularly pungent and appropriate. The words\n      “gem” and “<i>bijou</i>,” however, used in reference to my composition,\n      struck me as being, in some degree, feeble, and seemed to me to be\n      deficient in force. They were not sufficiently <i>prononcés</i>, (as we\n      have it in France).\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had hardly finished reading the “Toad,” when a friend placed in my hands\n      a copy of the “Mole,” a daily, enjoying high reputation for the keenness\n      of its perception about matters in general, and for the open, honest,\n      above-ground style of its editorials. The “Mole” spoke of the “Lollipop”\n       as follows:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We have just received the ‘Lollipop’ for October, and must say that\n      never before have we perused any single number of any periodical which\n      afforded us a felicity so supreme. We speak advisedly. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow’ and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ must look well to their laurels.\n      These prints, no doubt, surpass every thing in loudness of pretension,\n      but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this celebrated\n      Magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we\n      can comprehend. To be sure, it has a circulation of 300,000 and its\n      subscription-list has increased one-half within the last week, but then\n      the sum it disburses, monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly\n      enormous. We have it upon good authority, that Mr. Fatquack received no\n      less than sixty-two cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette, the\n      ‘Dish-Clout.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The contributors to the number before us are Mr. Crab, (the eminent\n      editor,) Snob, Mumblethumb, Fatquack, and others; but, after the\n      inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we prefer a diamond-like\n      effusion from the pen of a rising poet who writes over the signature\n      ‘Snob’—a nom de guerre which we predict will one day extinguish the\n      radiance of ‘Boz.’ ‘Snob,’ we learn, is a Mr. Thingum Bob, Esq., sole heir\n      of a wealthy merchant of this city, Thomas Bob, Esq., and a near relative\n      of the distinguished Mr. Thingum. The title of Mr. B.‘s admirable poem is\n      the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-by, as some\n      contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has already disgusted\n      the town with a great deal of drivel upon the same topic. There will be no\n      danger, however, of confounding the compositions. Sep. 15—1 t.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as the “Mole”\n       penetrated my soul with delight. The only objection which occurred to me\n      was, that the terms “contemptible vagabond” might have been better written\n      “<i>odious and</i> contemptible <i>wretch, villain and</i> vagabond.”\n       This would have sounded more gracefully, I think. “Diamond-like,” also,\n      was scarcely, it will be admitted, of sufficient intensity to express what\n      the “Mole” evidently <i>thought</i> of the brilliancy of the “Oil-of-Bob.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      On the same afternoon in which I saw these notices in the “Owl,” the\n      “Toad,” and the “Mole” I happened to meet with a copy of the\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs,” a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent of its\n      understanding. And it was the “Daddy-Long-Legs” which spoke thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The ‘Lollipop!!’ This gorgeous magazine is already before the public\n      for October. The question of preeminence is forever put to rest, and\n      hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the\n      ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ to make any farther spasmodic\n      attempts at competition. These journals may excel the ‘Lollipop’ in\n      outcry, but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this\n      celebrated Magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is past\n      comprehension. To be sure it has a circulation of precisely half a\n      million, and its subscription-list has increased seventy-five per cent,\n      within the last couple of days; but then the sums it disburses, monthly,\n      for contributions, are scarcely credible; we are cognizant of the fact,\n      that Mademoiselle Cribalittle received no less than eighty-seven cents and\n      a half for her late valuable Revolutionary Tale, entitled ‘The York-Town\n      Katy-Did, and the Bunker-Hill Katy-Didn’t.’\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The most able papers in the present number, are, of course, those\n      furnished by the editor, (the eminent Mr. Crab,) but there are numerous\n      magnificent contributions from such names as Snob, Mademoiselle\n      Cribalittle, Slyass, Mrs. Fibalittle, Mumblethumb, Mrs. Squibalittle, and\n      last, though not least, Fatquack. The world may well be challenged to\n      produce so rich a galaxy of genius.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The poem over the signature ‘Snob’ is, we find, attracting universal\n      commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves, if possible, even\n      more applause than it has received. The ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is the title of this\n      masterpiece of eloquence and art. One or two of our readers <i>may</i> have a\n      <i>very</i> faint, although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem\n      (?) similarly entitled, the perpetration of a miserable penny-a-liner,\n      mendicant, and cut-throat, connected in the capacity of scullion, we\n      believe, with one of the indecent prints about the purlieus of the city;\n      we beg them, for God’s sake, not to confound the compositions. The author\n      of the ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is, we hear, Thingum Bob, Esq., a gentleman of high\n      genius, and a scholar. ‘Snob’ is merely a <i>nom-de-guerre. Sept</i>. 15—1\n      <i>t.”</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      I could scarcely restrain my indignation while I perused the concluding\n      portions of this diatribe. It was clear to me that the yea-nay manner—not\n      to say the gentleness—the positive forbearance with which the\n      “Daddy-Long-Legs” spoke of that pig, the editor of the “Gad-Fly”—it\n      was evident to me, I say, that this gentleness of speech could proceed\n      from nothing else than a partiality for the Fly—whom it was clearly\n      the intention of the “Daddy-Long-Legs” to elevate into reputation at my\n      expense. Any one, indeed, might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the\n      real design of the “Daddy” been what it wished to appear, it, (the\n      “Daddy”) might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more pungent,\n      and altogether more to the purpose. The words “penny-a-liner,”\n       “mendicant,” “scullion,” and “cut-throat,” were epithets so intentionally\n      inexpressive and equivocal, as to be worse than nothing when applied to\n      the author of the very worst stanzas ever penned by one of the human race.\n      We all know what is meant by “damning with faint praise,” and, on the\n      other hand, who could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the\n      “Daddy”—that of glorifying with feeble abuse?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What the “Daddy” chose to say of the Fly, however, was no business of\n      mine. What it said of myself <i>was</i>. After the noble manner in which\n      the “Owl,” the “Toad,” the “Mole,” had expressed themselves in respect to\n      my ability, it was rather too much to be coolly spoken of by a thing like\n      the “Daddy-Long-Legs,” as merely “a gentleman of high genius and a\n      scholar.” Gentleman indeed! I made up my mind at once, either to get a\n      written apology from the “Daddy-Long-Legs,” or to call it out.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Full of this purpose, I looked about me to find a friend whom I could\n      entrust with a message to his Daddyship, and as the editor of the\n      “Lollipop” had given me marked tokens of regard, I at length concluded to\n      seek assistance upon the present occasion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory to my own\n      understanding, for the <i>very</i> peculiar countenance and demeanor with\n      which Mr. Crab listened to me, as I unfolded to him my design. He again\n      went through the scene of the bell-rope and cudgel, and did not omit the\n      duck. At one period I thought he really intended to quack. His fit,\n      nevertheless, finally subsided as before, and he began to act and speak in\n      a rational way. He declined bearing the cartel, however, and in fact,\n      dissuaded me from sending it at all; but was candid enough to admit that\n      the “Daddy-Long-Legs” had been disgracefully in the wrong—more\n      especially in what related to the epithets “gentleman and scholar.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Towards the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who really appeared to\n      take a paternal interest in my welfare, he suggested to me that I might\n      turn an honest penny, and, at the same time, advance my reputation, by\n      occasionally playing Thomas Hawk for the “Lollipop.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I begged Mr. Crab to inform me who was Mr. Thomas Hawk, and how it was\n      expected that I should play him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Here Mr. Crab again “made great eyes,” (as we say in Germany,) but at\n      length, recovering himself from a profound attack of astonishment, he\n      assured me that he employed the words “Thomas Hawk” to avoid the\n      colloquialism, Tommy, which was low—but that the true idea was Tommy\n      Hawk—or tomahawk—and that by “playing tomahawk” he referred to\n      scalping, brow-beating and otherwise using-up the herd of poor-devil\n      authors.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I assured my patron that, if this was all, I was perfectly resigned to the\n      task of playing Thomas Hawk. Hereupon Mr. Crab desired me to use-up the\n      editor of the “Gad-Fly” forthwith, in the fiercest style within the scope\n      of my ability, and as a specimen of my powers. This I did, upon the spot,\n      in a review of the original “Oil-of-Bob,” occupying thirty-six pages of\n      the “Lollipop.” I found playing Thomas Hawk, indeed, a far less onerous\n      occupation than poetizing; for I went upon <i>system</i> altogether, and\n      thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and well. My practice was\n      this. I bought auction copies (cheap) of “Lord Brougham’s Speeches,”\n       “Cobbett’s Complete Works,” the “New Slang-Syllabus,” the “Whole Art of\n      Snubbing,” “Prentice’s Billingsgate” (folio edition,) and “Lewis G.\n      Clarke on Tongue.” These works I cut up thoroughly with a currycomb, and\n      then, throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that\n      might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving the hard phrases,\n      which I threw into a large tin pepper-castor with longitudinal holes, so\n      that an entire sentence could get through without material injury. The\n      mixture was then ready for use. When called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I\n      anointed a sheet of fools-cap with the white of a gander’s egg; then,\n      shredding the thing to be reviewed as I had previously shredded the books,—only\n      with more care, so as to get every word separate—I threw the latter\n      shreds in with the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a\n      shake, and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap; where it\n      stuck. The effect was beautiful to behold. It was captivating. Indeed, the\n      reviews I brought to pass by this simple expedient have never been\n      approached, and were the wonder of the world. At first, through\n      bashfulness—the result of inexperience—I was a little put out\n      by a certain inconsistency—a certain air of the <i>bizarre</i>, (as\n      we say in France,) worn by the composition as a whole. All the phrases did\n      not <i>fit</i>, (as we say in the Anglo-Saxon). Many were quite awry.\n      Some, even, were up-side-down; and there were none of them which were not,\n      in some measure, injured in regard to effect, by this latter species of\n      accident, when it occurred—with the exception of Mr. Lewis Clarke’s\n      paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether stout, that they seemed\n      not particularly disconcerted by any extreme of position, but looked\n      equally happy and satisfactory, whether on their heads, or on their heels.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What became of the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” after the publication of my\n      criticism on his “Oil-of-Bob,” it is somewhat difficult to determine. The\n      most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept himself to death. At all\n      events he disappeared instantaneously from the face of the earth, and no\n      man has seen even the ghost of him since.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This matter having been properly accomplished, and the Furies appeased, I\n      grew at once into high favor with Mr. Crab. He took me into his\n      confidence, gave me a permanent situation as Thomas Hawk of the\n      “Lollipop,” and, as for the present, he could afford me no salary, allowed\n      me to profit, at discretion, by his advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My dear Thingum,” said he to me one day after dinner, “I respect your\n      abilities and love you as a son. You shall be my heir. When I die I will\n      bequeath you the ‘Lollipop.’ In the meantime I will make a man of you—I\n      <i>will</i>—provided always that you follow my counsel. The first\n      thing to do is to get rid of the old bore.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Boar?” said I inquiringly—“pig, eh?—<i>aper?</i> (as we say\n      in Latin)—who?—where?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Your father,” said he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Precisely,” I replied,—“pig.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You have your fortune to make, Thingum,” resumed Mr. Crab, “and that\n      governor of yours is a millstone about your neck. We must cut him at\n      once.” [Here I took out my knife.] “We must cut him,” continued Mr. Crab,\n      “decidedly and forever. He won’t do—he <i>won’t</i>. Upon second\n      thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane him, or something of that\n      kind.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What do you say,” I suggested modestly, “to my kicking him in the first\n      instance, caning him afterwards, and winding up by tweaking his nose?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and then answered:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I think, Mr. Bob, that what you propose would answer sufficiently well—indeed\n      remarkably well—that is to say, as far as it went—but barbers\n      are exceedingly hard to cut, and I think, upon the whole, that, having\n      performed upon Thomas Bob the operations you suggest, it would be\n      advisable to blacken, with your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and\n      thoroughly, to prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable\n      promenades. After doing this, I really do not perceive that you can do any\n      more. However—it might be just as well to roll him once or twice in\n      the gutter, and then put him in charge of the police. Any time the next\n      morning you can call at the watch-house and swear an assault.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me personally,\n      which was evinced in this excellent advice of Mr. Crab, and I did not fail\n      to profit by it forthwith. The result was, that I got rid of the old bore,\n      and began to feel a little independent and gentleman-like. The want of\n      money, however, was, for a few weeks, a source of some discomfort; but at\n      length, by carefully putting to use my two eyes, and observing how matters\n      went just in front of my nose, I perceived how the thing was to be brought\n      about. I say “thing”—be it observed—for they tell me the Latin\n      for it is <i>rem</i>. By the way, talking of Latin, can any one tell me\n      the meaning of <i>quocunque</i>—or what is the meaning of <i>modo?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      My plan was exceedingly simple. I bought, for a song, a sixteenth of the\n      “Snapping-Turtle”:—that was all. The thing was\n      <i>done</i>, and I put money in my purse. There were some trivial\n      arrangements afterwards, to be sure; but these formed no portion of the\n      plan. They were a consequence—a result. For example, I bought pen,\n      ink, and paper, and put them into furious activity. Having thus completed\n      a Magazine article, I gave it, for appellation, “Fol-Lol, <i>by the\n      Author of</i> ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’” and enveloped it to\n      the “Goosetherumfoodle.” That journal, however, having\n      pronounced it “twattle” in the “Monthly Notices to\n      Correspondents,” I reheaded the paper\n      “‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle,’ by Thingum Bob, Esq., Author of\n      the Ode on ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’ <i>and</i> Editor of the\n      ‘Snapping-Turtle.’” With this amendment, I re-enclosed\n      it to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and, while I awaited a reply,\n      published daily, in the “Turtle,” six columns of what may be\n      termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the literary merits\n      of the “Goosetherumfoodle,” as well as of the personal\n      character of the editor of the “Goosetherumfoodle.” At the\n      end of a week the “Goosetherumfoodle” discovered that it had,\n      by some odd mistake, “confounded a stupid article, headed\n      ‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle’ and composed by some unknown ignoramus,\n      with a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled, the work of Thingum\n      Bob, Esq., the celebrated author of ‘The Oil-of-Bob.’”\n      The “Goosetherumfoodle” deeply “regretted this very\n      natural accident,” and promised, moreover, an insertion of the\n      <i>genuine</i> “Hey-Diddle-Diddle” in the very next number of\n      the Magazine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The fact is, I <i>thought</i>—I <i>really</i> thought—I\n      thought at the time—I thought <i>then</i>—and have no reason\n      for thinking otherwise <i>now</i>—that the “Goosetherumfoodle” <i>did</i>\n      make a mistake. With the best intentions in the world, I never knew any\n      thing that made as many singular mistakes as the “Goosetherumfoodle.” From\n      that day I took a liking to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and the result was I\n      soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits, and did not fail to\n      expatiate upon them, in the “Turtle,” whenever a fitting opportunity\n      occurred. And it is to be regarded as a very peculiar coincidence—as\n      one of those positively <i>remarkable</i> coincidences which set a man to\n      serious thinking—that just such a total revolution of opinion—just\n      such entire <i>bouleversement</i>, (as we say in French,)—just such\n      thorough <i>topsiturviness</i>, (if I may be permitted to employ a rather\n      forcible term of the Choctaws,) as happened, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,\n      between myself on the one part, and the “Goosetherumfoodle” on the other,\n      did actually again happen, in a brief period afterwards, and with\n      precisely similar circumstances, in the case of myself and the\n      “Rowdy-Dow,” and in the case of myself and the “Hum-Drum.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, I at length consummated my\n      triumphs by “putting money in my purse,” and thus may be said really and\n      fairly to have commenced that brilliant and eventful career which rendered\n      me illustrious, and which now enables me to say, with Chateaubriand, “I\n      have made history”—“<i>J’ai fait l’histoire</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I have indeed “made history.” From the bright epoch which I now record, my\n      actions—my works—are the property of mankind. They are\n      familiar to the world. It is, then, needless for me to detail how, soaring\n      rapidly, I fell heir to the “Lollipop”—how I merged this journal in\n      the “Hum-Drum”—how again I made purchase of the “Rowdy-Dow,” thus\n      combining the three periodicals—how, lastly, I effected a bargain\n      for the sole remaining rival, and united all the literature of the country\n      in one magnificent Magazine, known everywhere as the\n    </p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n      “Rowdy-Dow, Lollipop, Hum-Drum,<br>\n      and<br>\n      goosetherumfoodle.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Yes; I have made history. My fame is universal. It extends to the\n      uttermost ends of the earth. You cannot take up a common newspaper in\n      which you shall not see some allusion to the immortal Thingum Bob. It is\n      Mr. Thingum Bob said so, and Mr. Thingum Bob wrote this, and Mr. Thingum\n      Bob did that. But I am meek and expire with an humble heart. After all,\n      what is it?—this indescribable something which men will persist in\n      terming “genius?” I agree with Buffon—with Hogarth—it is but\n      <i>diligence</i> after all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Look at <i>me!</i>—how I labored—how I toiled—how I\n      wrote! Ye Gods, did I <i>not</i> write? I knew not the word “ease.” By day\n      I adhered to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I consumed the\n      midnight oil. You should have seen me—you <i>should</i>. I leaned to\n      the right. I leaned to the left. I sat forward. I sat backward. I sat upon\n      end. I sat <i>tete baissée</i>, (as they have it in the Kickapoo,) bowing\n      my head close to the alabaster page. And, through all, I—<i>wrote</i>.\n      Through joy and through sorrow, I—<i>wrote</i>. Through hunger and\n      through thirst, I—<i>wrote</i>. Through good report and through ill\n      report, I—<i>wrote</i>. Through sunshine and through moonshine, I—<i>wrote.\n      What</i> I wrote it is unnecessary to say. The <i>style!</i>—that\n      was the thing. I caught it from Fatquack—whizz!—fizz!——\n      and I am giving you a specimen of it now.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.7\"></a>HOW TO WRITE A “BLACKWOOD” ARTICLE</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n      “In the name of the Prophet—figs!!”<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—<i>Cry of the Turkish fig-peddler.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      I presume everybody has heard of me. My name is the Signora Psyche\n      Zenobia. This I know to be a fact. Nobody but my enemies ever calls me\n      Suky Snobbs. I have been assured that Suky is but a vulgar corruption of\n      Psyche, which is good Greek, and means “the soul” (that’s me, I’m all\n      soul) and sometimes “a butterfly,” which latter meaning undoubtedly\n      alludes to my appearance in my new crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue\n      Arabian mantelet, and the trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven\n      flounces of orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs—any person who\n      should look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn’t Snobbs.\n      Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy. Tabitha\n      Turnip indeed! Oh the little wretch! But what can we expect from a turnip?\n      Wonder if she remembers the old adage about “blood out of a turnip,” &amp;c.?\n      [Mem. put her in mind of it the first opportunity.] [Mem. again—pull\n      her nose.] Where was I? Ah! I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere\n      corruption of Zenobia, and that Zenobia was a queen—(So am I. Dr.\n      Moneypenny always calls me the Queen of the Hearts)—and that\n      Zenobia, as well as Psyche, is good Greek, and that my father was “a\n      Greek,” and that consequently I have a right to our patronymic, which is\n      Zenobia and not by any means Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me\n      Suky Snobbs. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I said before, everybody has heard of me. I am that very Signora Psyche\n      Zenobia, so justly celebrated as corresponding secretary to the\n      “Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total, Young, Belles, Lettres,\n      Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical, Association, To, Civilize,\n      Humanity.” Dr. Moneypenny made the title for us, and says he chose it\n      because it sounded big like an empty rum-puncheon. (A vulgar man that\n      sometimes—but he’s deep.) We all sign the initials of the society\n      after our names, in the fashion of the R. S. A., Royal Society of Arts—the\n      S. D. U. K., Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, &amp;c, &amp;c.\n      Dr. Moneypenny says that S. stands for stale, and that D. U. K. spells\n      duck, (but it don’t,) that S. D. U. K. stands for Stale Duck and not for\n      Lord Brougham’s society—but then Dr. Moneypenny is such a queer man\n      that I am never sure when he is telling me the truth. At any rate we\n      always add to our names the initials P. R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A.\n      T. C. H.—that is to say, Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea,\n      Total, Young, Belles, Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical,\n      Association, To, Civilize, Humanity—one letter for each word, which\n      is a decided improvement upon Lord Brougham. Dr. Moneypenny will have it\n      that our initials give our true character—but for my life I can’t\n      see what he means.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor, and the strenuous\n      exertions of the association to get itself into notice, it met with no\n      very great success until I joined it. The truth is, the members indulged\n      in too flippant a tone of discussion. The papers read every Saturday\n      evening were characterized less by depth than buffoonery. They were all\n      whipped syllabub. There was no investigation of first causes, first\n      principles. There was no investigation of any thing at all. There was no\n      attention paid to that great point, the “fitness of things.” In short\n      there was no fine writing like this. It was all low—very! No\n      profundity, no reading, no metaphysics—nothing which the learned\n      call spirituality, and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as cant.\n      [Dr. M. says I ought to spell “cant” with a capital K—but I know\n      better.]\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a better style\n      of thinking and writing, and all the world knows how well I have\n      succeeded. We get up as good papers now in the P. R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U.\n      E. B. A. T. C. H. as any to be found even in Blackwood. I say, Blackwood,\n      because I have been assured that the finest writing, upon every subject,\n      is to be discovered in the pages of that justly celebrated Magazine. We\n      now take it for our model upon all themes, and are getting into rapid\n      notice accordingly. And, after all, it’s not so very difficult a matter to\n      compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only goes\n      properly about it. Of course I don’t speak of the political articles.\n      Everybody knows how they are managed, since Dr. Moneypenny explained it.\n      Mr. Blackwood has a pair of tailor’s-shears, and three apprentices who\n      stand by him for orders. One hands him the “Times,” another the “Examiner”\n       and a third a “Culley’s New Compendium of Slang-Whang.” Mr. B. merely cuts\n      out and intersperses. It is soon done—nothing but “Examiner,”\n       “Slang-Whang,” and “Times”—then “Times,” “Slang-Whang,” and\n      “Examiner”—and then “Times,” “Examiner,” and “Slang-Whang.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous articles;\n      and the best of these come under the head of what Dr. Moneypenny calls the\n      bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and what everybody else calls the\n      intensities. This is a species of writing which I have long known how to\n      appreciate, although it is only since my late visit to Mr. Blackwood\n      (deputed by the society) that I have been made aware of the exact method\n      of composition. This method is very simple, but not so much so as the\n      politics. Upon my calling at Mr. B.‘s, and making known to him the wishes\n      of the society, he received me with great civility, took me into his\n      study, and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My dear madam,” said he, evidently struck with my majestic appearance,\n      for I had on the crimson satin, with the green agraffas, and\n      orange-colored auriclas. “My dear madam,” said he, “sit down. The matter\n      stands thus: In the first place your writer of intensities must have very\n      black ink, and a very big pen, with a very blunt nib. And, mark me, Miss\n      Psyche Zenobia!” he continued, after a pause, with the most expressive\n      energy and solemnity of manner, “mark me!—that pen—must—never\n      be mended! Herein, madam, lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. I\n      assume upon myself to say, that no individual, of however great genius\n      ever wrote with a good pen—understand me,—a good article. You\n      may take, it for granted, that when manuscript can be read it is never\n      worth reading. This is a leading principle in our faith, to which if you\n      cannot readily assent, our conference is at an end.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He paused. But, of course, as I had no wish to put an end to the\n      conference, I assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one, too, of\n      whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware. He seemed pleased,\n      and went on with his instructions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It may appear invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to refer you to any\n      article, or set of articles, in the way of model or study, yet perhaps I\n      may as well call your attention to a few cases. Let me see. There was ‘The\n      Dead Alive,’ a capital thing!—the record of a gentleman’s sensations\n      when entombed before the breath was out of his body—full of tastes,\n      terror, sentiment, metaphysics, and erudition. You would have sworn that\n      the writer had been born and brought up in a coffin. Then we had the\n      ‘Confessions of an Opium-eater’—fine, very fine!—glorious\n      imagination—deep philosophy acute speculation—plenty of fire\n      and fury, and a good spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. That was a\n      nice bit of flummery, and went down the throats of the people\n      delightfully. They would have it that Coleridge wrote the paper—but\n      not so. It was composed by my pet baboon, Juniper, over a rummer of\n      Hollands and water, ‘hot, without sugar.’” [This I could scarcely have\n      believed had it been anybody but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of it.]\n      “Then there was ‘The Involuntary Experimentalist,’ all about a gentleman\n      who got baked in an oven, and came out alive and well, although certainly\n      done to a turn. And then there was ‘The Diary of a Late Physician,’ where\n      the merit lay in good rant, and indifferent Greek—both of them\n      taking things with the public. And then there was ‘The Man in the Bell,’ a\n      paper by-the-by, Miss Zenobia, which I cannot sufficiently recommend to\n      your attention. It is the history of a young person who goes to sleep\n      under the clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a\n      funeral. The sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pulling out his\n      tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. Sensations are the great\n      things after all. Should you ever be drowned or hung, be sure and make a\n      note of your sensations—they will be worth to you ten guineas a\n      sheet. If you wish to write forcibly, Miss Zenobia, pay minute attention\n      to the sensations.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That I certainly will, Mr. Blackwood,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Good!” he replied. “I see you are a pupil after my own heart. But I must\n      put you au fait to the details necessary in composing what may be\n      denominated a genuine Blackwood article of the sensation stamp—the\n      kind which you will understand me to say I consider the best for all\n      purposes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape as no one\n      ever got into before. The oven, for instance,—that was a good hit.\n      But if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if you cannot\n      conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed up in an earthquake,\n      or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will have to be contented with simply\n      imagining some similar misadventure. I should prefer, however, that you\n      have the actual fact to bear you out. Nothing so well assists the fancy,\n      as an experimental knowledge of the matter in hand. ‘Truth is strange,’\n      you know, ‘stranger than fiction’—besides being more to the\n      purpose.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters, and would go and\n      hang myself forthwith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Good!” he replied, “do so;—although hanging is somewhat hacknied.\n      Perhaps you might do better. Take a dose of Brandreth’s pills, and then\n      give us your sensations. However, my instructions will apply equally well\n      to any variety of misadventure, and in your way home you may easily get\n      knocked in the head, or run over by an omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or\n      drowned in a gutter. But to proceed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the tone, or\n      manner, of your narration. There is the tone didactic, the tone\n      enthusiastic, the tone natural—all commonplace enough. But\n      then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately come much into\n      use. It consists in short sentences. Somehow thus: Can’t be too brief.\n      Can’t be too snappish. Always a full stop. And never a paragraph.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional. Some of\n      our best novelists patronize this tone. The words must be all in a whirl,\n      like a humming-top, and make a noise very similar, which answers\n      remarkably well instead of meaning. This is the best of all possible\n      styles where the writer is in too great a hurry to think.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The tone metaphysical is also a good one. If you know any big words this\n      is your chance for them. Talk of the Ionic and Eleatic schools—of\n      Archytas, Gorgias, and Alcmaeon. Say something about objectivity and\n      subjectivity. Be sure and abuse a man named Locke. Turn up your nose at\n      things in general, and when you let slip any thing a little too absurd,\n      you need not be at the trouble of scratching it out, but just add a\n      footnote and say that you are indebted for the above profound observation\n      to the ‘Kritik der reinem Vernunft,’ or to the ‘Metaphysithe Anfongsgrunde\n      der Noturwissenchaft.’ This would look erudite and—and—and\n      frank.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There are various other tones of equal celebrity, but I shall mention\n      only two more—the tone transcendental and the tone heterogeneous. In\n      the former the merit consists in seeing into the nature of affairs a very\n      great deal farther than anybody else. This second sight is very efficient\n      when properly managed. A little reading of the ‘Dial’ will carry you a\n      great way. Eschew, in this case, big words; get them as small as possible,\n      and write them upside down. Look over Channing’s poems and quote what he\n      says about a ‘fat little man with a delusive show of Can.’ Put in\n      something about the Supernal Oneness. Don’t say a syllable about the\n      Infernal Twoness. Above all, study innuendo. Hint everything—assert\n      nothing. If you feel inclined to say ‘bread and butter,’ do not by any\n      means say it outright. You may say any thing and every thing approaching\n      to ‘bread and butter.’ You may hint at buck-wheat cake, or you may even go\n      so far as to insinuate oat-meal porridge, but if bread and butter be your\n      real meaning, be cautious, my dear Miss Psyche, not on any account to say\n      ‘bread and butter!’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I lived. He\n      kissed me and continued:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious mixture, in equal\n      proportions, of all the other tones in the world, and is consequently made\n      up of every thing deep, great, odd, piquant, pertinent, and pretty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and tone. The\n      most important portion—in fact, the soul of the whole business, is\n      yet to be attended to—I allude to the filling up. It is not to be\n      supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been leading the life of a\n      book worm. And yet above all things it is necessary that your article have\n      an air of erudition, or at least afford evidence of extensive general\n      reading. Now I’ll put you in the way of accomplishing this point. See\n      here!” (pulling down some three or four ordinary-looking volumes, and\n      opening them at random). “By casting your eye down almost any page of any\n      book in the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host of little\n      scraps of either learning or <i>bel-esprit-ism</i>, which are the very thing for\n      the spicing of a Blackwood article. You might as well note down a few\n      while I read them to you.

In taking leave of me, Mr. B. made a proposition for the\n      purchase of the paper when written; but as he could offer me only fifty\n      guineas a sheet, I thought it better to let our society have it, than\n      sacrifice it for so paltry a sum.

In this excursion I was attended by one negro servant,\n      Pompey, and my little lap-dog Diana, whom I had brought with me from\n      Philadelphia. It was not, however, until late in the afternoon that I\n      fully succeeded in my arduous undertaking. An important event then\n      happened of which the following Blackwood article, in the tone\n      heterogeneous, is the substance and result.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.8\"></a>A PREDICAMENT</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\nWhat chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?—C<small>OMUS</small>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      It was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the goodly\n      city of Edina. The confusion and bustle in the streets were terrible. Men\n      were talking. Women were screaming. Children were choking. Pigs were\n      whistling. Carts they rattled. Bulls they bellowed. Cows they lowed.\n      Horses they neighed. Cats they caterwauled. Dogs they danced. <i>Danced!</i>\n      Could it then be possible? Danced! Alas, thought I, my dancing days are\n      over! Thus it is ever. What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and\n      anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative contemplation,\n      especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting, and eternal, and\n      continual, and, as one might say, the—continued—yes, the\n      continued and continuous, bitter, harassing, disturbing, and, if I may be\n      allowed the expression, the very disturbing influence of the serene, and\n      godlike, and heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying effect of\n      what may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most truly enviable—nay!\n      the most benignly beautiful, the most deliciously ethereal, and, as it\n      were, the most pretty (if I may use so bold an expression) thing (pardon\n      me, gentle reader!) in the world—but I am always led away by my\n      feelings. In such a mind, I repeat, what a host of recollections are\n      stirred up by a trifle! The dogs danced! I—I could not! They frisked—I\n      wept. They capered—I sobbed aloud. Touching circumstances! which\n      cannot fail to bring to the recollection of the classical reader that\n      exquisite passage in relation to the fitness of things, which is to be\n      found in the commencement of the third volume of that admirable and\n      venerable Chinese novel the Jo-Go-Slow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In my solitary walk through, the city I had two humble but faithful\n      companions. Diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures! She had a quantity of\n      hair over her one eye, and a blue ribbon tied fashionably around her\n      neck. Diana was not more than five inches in height, but her head was\n      somewhat bigger than her body, and her tail being cut off exceedingly\n      close, gave an air of injured innocence to the interesting animal which\n      rendered her a favorite with all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And Pompey, my negro!—sweet Pompey! how shall I ever forget thee? I\n      had taken Pompey’s arm. He was three feet in height (I like to be\n      particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of age. He had\n      bow-legs and was corpulent. His mouth should not be called small, nor his\n      ears short. His teeth, however, were like pearl, and his large full eyes\n      were deliciously white. Nature had endowed him with no neck, and had\n      placed his ankles (as usual with that race) in the middle of the upper\n      portion of the feet. He was clad with a striking simplicity. His sole\n      garments were a stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly-new\n      drab overcoat which had formerly been in the service of the tall, stately,\n      and illustrious Dr. Moneypenny. It was a good overcoat. It was well cut.\n      It was well made. The coat was nearly new. Pompey held it up out of the\n      dirt with both hands.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There were three persons in our party, and two of them have already been\n      the subject of remark. There was a third—that person was myself. I\n      am the Signora Psyche Zenobia. I am not Suky Snobbs. My appearance is\n      commanding. On the memorable occasion of which I speak I was habited in a\n      crimson satin dress, with a sky-blue Arabian mantelet. And the dress had\n      trimmings of green agraffas, and seven graceful flounces of the\n      orange-colored auricula. I thus formed the third of the party. There was\n      the poodle. There was Pompey. There was myself. We were three. Thus it is\n      said there were originally but three Furies—Melty, Nimmy, and Hetty—Meditation,\n      Memory, and Fiddling.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended at a respectable\n      distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the populous and very pleasant\n      streets of the now deserted Edina. On a sudden, there presented itself to\n      view a church—a Gothic cathedral—vast, venerable, and with a\n      tall steeple, which towered into the sky. What madness now possessed me?\n      Why did I rush upon my fate? I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to\n      ascend the giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city.\n      The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny prevailed. I\n      entered the ominous archway. Where then was my guardian angel?—if\n      indeed such angels there be. If! Distressing monosyllable! what world of\n      mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and uncertainty is there involved in thy\n      two letters! I entered the ominous archway! I entered; and, without injury\n      to my orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the portal, and emerged\n      within the vestibule. Thus it is said the immense river Alfred passed,\n      unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I thought the staircase would never have an end. Round! Yes, they went\n      round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I could not help\n      surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose supporting arm I leaned\n      in all the confidence of early affection—I could not help surmising\n      that the upper end of the continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally,\n      or perhaps designedly, removed. I paused for breath; and, in the meantime,\n      an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and also in a\n      metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without notice. It appeared\n      to me—indeed I was quite confident of the fact—I could not be\n      mistaken—no! I had, for some moments, carefully and anxiously\n      observed the motions of my Diana—I say that I could not be mistaken—Diana\n      smelt a rat! At once I called Pompey’s attention to the subject, and he—he\n      agreed with me. There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt.\n      The rat had been smelled—and by Diana. Heavens! shall I ever forget\n      the intense excitement of the moment? Alas! what is the boasted intellect\n      of man? The rat!—it was there—that is to say, it was\n      somewhere. Diana smelled the rat. I—I could not! Thus it is said the\n      Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very powerful perfume,\n      while to others it is perfectly scentless.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three or four\n      more upward steps intervening between us and the summit. We still\n      ascended, and now only one step remained. One step! One little, little\n      step! Upon one such little step in the great staircase of human life how\n      vast a sum of human happiness or misery depends! I thought of myself, then\n      of Pompey, and then of the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which\n      surrounded us. I thought of Pompey!—alas, I thought of love! I\n      thought of my many false steps which have been taken, and may be taken\n      again. I resolved to be more cautious, more reserved. I abandoned the arm\n      of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one remaining step,\n      and gained the chamber of the belfry. I was followed immediately afterward\n      by my poodle. Pompey alone remained behind. I stood at the head of the\n      staircase, and encouraged him to ascend. He stretched forth to me his\n      hand, and unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold\n      upon the overcoat. Will the gods never cease their persecution? The\n      overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, Pompey stepped upon the\n      long and trailing skirt of the overcoat. He stumbled and fell—this\n      consequence was inevitable. He fell forward, and, with his accursed head,\n      striking me full in the—in the breast, precipitated me headlong,\n      together with himself, upon the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the\n      belfry. But my revenge was sure, sudden, and complete. Seizing him\n      furiously by the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of\n      black, and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every\n      manifestation of disdain. It fell among the ropes of the belfry and\n      remained. Pompey arose, and said no word. But he regarded me piteously\n      with his large eyes and—sighed. Ye Gods—that sigh! It sunk\n      into my heart. And the hair—the wool! Could I have reached that wool\n      I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of regret. But alas! it\n      was now far beyond my grasp. As it dangled among the cordage of the bell,\n      I fancied it alive. I fancied that it stood on end with indignation. Thus\n      the happy-dandy Flos Aeris of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower,\n      which will live when pulled up by the roots. The natives suspend it by a\n      cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an aperture\n      through which to survey the city of Edina. Windows there were none. The\n      sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square\n      opening, about a foot in diameter, at a height of about seven feet from\n      the floor. Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect? I resolved\n      to clamber up to this hole. A vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other\n      cabalistic-looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to it;\n      and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery. Between\n      the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my\n      body—yet I was desperate, and determined to persevere. I called\n      Pompey to my side.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You perceive that aperture, Pompey. I wish to look through it. You will\n      stand here just beneath the hole—so. Now, hold out one of your\n      hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it—thus. Now, the other hand,\n      Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your shoulders.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that I could\n      easily pass my head and neck through the aperture. The prospect was\n      sublime. Nothing could be more magnificent. I merely paused a moment to\n      bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey that I would be considerate\n      and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders. I told him I would be\n      tender of his feelings—ossi tender que beefsteak. Having done this\n      justice to my faithful friend, I gave myself up with great zest and\n      enthusiasm to the enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself\n      out before my eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate. I will not describe\n      the city of Edinburgh. Every one has been to the city of Edinburgh. Every\n      one has been to Edinburgh—the classic Edina. I will confine myself\n      to the momentous details of my own lamentable adventure. Having, in some\n      measure, satisfied my curiosity in regard to the extent, situation, and\n      general appearance of the city, I had leisure to survey the church in\n      which I was, and the delicate architecture of the steeple. I observed that\n      the aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the\n      dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the street,\n      as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the French watches. No\n      doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant, to adjust,\n      when necessary, the hands of the clock from within. I observed also, with\n      surprise, the immense size of these hands, the longest of which could not\n      have been less than ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine\n      inches in breadth. They were of solid steel apparently, and their edges\n      appeared to be sharp. Having noticed these particulars, and some others, I\n      again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below, and soon became\n      absorbed in contemplation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of Pompey, who\n      declared that he could stand it no longer, and requested that I would be\n      so kind as to come down. This was unreasonable, and I told him so in a\n      speech of some length. He replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of\n      my ideas upon the subject. I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain\n      words, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus\n      e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his words\n      little better than an ennemywerrybor’em. With this he appeared satisfied,\n      and I resumed my contemplations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as I was\n      deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was startled by\n      something very cold which pressed with a gentle pressure on the back of my\n      neck. It is needless to say that I felt inexpressibly alarmed. I knew that\n      Pompey was beneath my feet, and that Diana was sitting, according to my\n      explicit directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the\n      room. What could it be? Alas! I but too soon discovered. Turning my head\n      gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror, that the huge,\n      glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock had, in the course of\n      its hourly revolution, descended upon my neck. There was, I knew, not a\n      second to be lost. I pulled back at once—but it was too late. There\n      was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap\n      in which it was so fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower\n      with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived. The agony of that moment is\n      not to be imagined. I threw up my hands and endeavored, with all my\n      strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar. I might as well have\n      tried to lift the cathedral itself. Down, down, down it came, closer and\n      yet closer. I screamed to Pompey for aid; but he said that I had hurt his\n      feelings by calling him “an ignorant old squint-eye.” I yelled to Diana;\n      but she only said “bow-wow-wow,” and that I had told her “on no account to\n      stir from the corner.” Thus I had no relief to expect from my associates.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now discovered\n      the literal import of that classical phrase) had not stopped, nor was it\n      likely to stop, in its career. Down and still down, it came. It had\n      already buried its sharp edge a full inch in my flesh, and my sensations\n      grew indistinct and confused. At one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia\n      with the stately Dr. Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr.\n      Blackwood receiving his invaluable instructions. And then again the sweet\n      recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I thought of\n      that happy period when the world was not all a desert, and Pompey not\n      altogether cruel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The ticking of the machinery amused me. Amused me, I say, for my\n      sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most trifling\n      circumstances afforded me pleasure. The eternal click-clak, click-clak,\n      click-clak of the clock was the most melodious of music in my ears, and\n      occasionally even put me in mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr.\n      Ollapod. Then there were the great figures upon the dial-plate—how\n      intelligent how intellectual, they all looked! And presently they took to\n      dancing the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who performed the\n      most to my satisfaction. She was evidently a lady of breeding. None of\n      your swaggerers, and nothing at all indelicate in her motions. She did the\n      pirouette to admiration—whirling round upon her apex. I made an\n      endeavor to hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with\n      her exertions—and it was not until then that I fully perceived my\n      lamentable situation. Lamentable indeed! The bar had buried itself two\n      inches in my neck. I was aroused to a sense of exquisite pain. I prayed\n      for death, and, in the agony of the moment, could not help repeating those\n      exquisite verses of the poet Miguel De Cervantes:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Vanny Buren, tan escondida<br>\n     Query no te senty venny<br>\n     Pork and pleasure, delly morry<br>\n     Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!\n</p>\n<p>\n      But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient to\n      startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the cruel pressure of the\n      machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets. While I was thinking\n      how I should possibly manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my\n      head, and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the rain\n      gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building. The loss of the eye\n      was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with\n      which it regarded me after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just\n      under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had\n      they not been disgusting. Such a winking and blinking were never before\n      seen. This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only\n      irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude,\n      but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which\n      always exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. I was\n      forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or not, in\n      exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose. I\n      was presently relieved, however, by the dropping out of the other eye. In\n      falling it took the same direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its\n      fellow. Both rolled out of the gutter together, and in truth I was very\n      glad to get rid of them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there was only\n      a little bit of skin to cut through. My sensations were those of entire\n      happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at farthest, I should be\n      relieved from my disagreeable situation. And in this expectation I was not\n      at all deceived. At twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon,\n      precisely, the huge minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its\n      terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck. I was not\n      sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at\n      length make a final separation from my body. It first rolled down the side\n      of the steeple, then lodge, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and then\n      made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the street.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most singular—nay,\n      of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and incomprehensible\n      character. My senses were here and there at one and the same moment. With\n      my head I imagined, at one time, that I, the head, was the real Signora\n      Psyche Zenobia—at another I felt convinced that myself, the body,\n      was the proper identity. To clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my\n      pocket for my snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a\n      pinch of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, I became\n      immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at once\n      down to my head. It took a pinch with great satisfaction, and smiled me an\n      acknowledgement in return. Shortly afterward it made me a speech, which I\n      could hear but indistinctly without ears. I gathered enough, however, to\n      know that it was astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such\n      circumstances. In the concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of\n      Ariosto—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Il pover hommy che non sera corty<br>\n      And have a combat tenty erry morty;\n    </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      thus comparing me to the hero who, in\n      the heat of the combat, not perceiving that he was dead, continued to\n      contest the battle with inextinguishable valor. There was nothing now to\n      prevent my getting down from my elevation, and I did so. What it was that\n      Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet been able to\n      find out. The fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear, and shut his two\n      eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids. Finally,\n      throwing off his overcoat, he made one spring for the staircase and\n      disappeared. I hurled after the scoundrel these vehement words of\n      Demosthenes—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Andrew O’Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly,\n    </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the\n      shaggy-haired Diana. Alas! what a horrible vision affronted my eyes? Was\n      that a rat I saw skulking into his hole? Are these the picked bones of\n      the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by the monster? Ye gods!\n      and what do I behold—is that the departed spirit, the shade, the\n      ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I perceive sitting with a grace so\n      melancholy, in the corner? Hearken! for she speaks, and, heavens! it is\n      in the German of Schiller—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      “Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun<br>\n       Duk she! duk she!”\n    </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      Alas! and are not her words too true?\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      “And if I died, at least I died<br>\n       For thee—for thee.”\n</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      Sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf. Dogless,\n      niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy Signora Psyche\n      Zenobia? Alas—nothing! I have done.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.9\"></a>MYSTIFICATION</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n     Slid, if these be your “passados” and “montantes,”\n     I’ll have none o’ them.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—N<small>ED</small> K<small>NOWLES</small>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      The Baron Ritzner von Jung was a noble Hungarian family, every member of\n      which (at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend)\n      was more or less remarkable for talent of some description—the\n      majority for that species of <i>grotesquerie</i> in conception of which\n      Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a vivid, although by no means the\n      most vivid exemplifications. My acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at\n      the magnificent Chateau Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not\n      to be made public, threw me during the summer months of the year\n      18—. Here it was that I obtained a place in his regard, and here,\n      with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental\n      conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear, as the intimacy\n      which had at first permitted it became more close; and when, after three\n      years separation, we met at G——n, I knew all that it was\n      necessary to know of the character of the Baron Ritzner von Jung.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the\n      college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I remember\n      still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by all parties at\n      first sight “the most remarkable man in the world,” no person made any\n      attempt at accounting for his opinion. That he was unique appeared so\n      undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity\n      consisted. But, letting this matter pass for the present, I will merely\n      observe that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits\n      of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons,\n      purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him, an\n      influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the same time the most\n      indefinite and altogether unaccountable. Thus the brief period of his\n      residence at the university forms an era in its annals, and is\n      characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its\n      dependencies as “that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of\n      the Baron Ritzner von Jung.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon his advent to G——n, he sought me out in my apartments.\n      He was then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was impossible\n      to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded. He\n      might have been fifteen or fifty, and was twenty-one years and seven\n      months. He was by no means a handsome man—perhaps the reverse. The\n      contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh. His forehead was\n      lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and\n      meaningless. About the mouth there was more to be observed. The lips were\n      gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion\n      that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex, combination\n      of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of\n      unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said, that the\n      Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found, who make\n      the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives.\n      For this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue,\n      while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for\n      carrying his prospects into effect. I firmly believe that no student at\n      G——n, during that renowned epoch so quaintly termed the\n      domination of the Baron Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the\n      mystery which overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person at\n      the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to be\n      capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog at the\n      garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of\n      Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology. This,\n      too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all\n      conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about,\n      if not directly by him, at least plainly through his intermediate agency\n      or connivance. The beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique,\n      lay in that consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive\n      knowledge of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by\n      means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he\n      was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and partly in\n      consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention,\n      and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of Alma Mater. The\n      deep, the poignant, the overwhelming mortification, which upon each such\n      failure of his praise worthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of\n      his countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity\n      in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions. The adroitness, too,\n      was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the\n      sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created—from his own\n      person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. In no instance\n      before that of which I speak, have I known the habitual mystific escape\n      the natural consequence of his manoevres—an attachment of the\n      ludicrous to his own character and person. Continually enveloped in an\n      atmosphere of whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of\n      society; and not even his own household have for a moment associated\n      other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the\n      Baron Ritzner von Jung.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      During the epoch of his residence at G——n it really appeared\n      that the demon of the <i>dolce far niente</i> lay like an incubus upon\n      the university. Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and drinking\n      and making merry. The apartments of the students were converted into so\n      many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of them all more famous or\n      more frequented than that of the Baron. Our carousals here were many, and\n      boisterous, and long, and never unfruitful of events.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak, and\n      an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. The company consisted of seven\n      or eight individuals besides the Baron and myself. Most of these were\n      young men of wealth, of high connection, of great family pride, and all\n      alive with an exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra\n      German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions some\n      recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four desperate and fatal\n      rencounters at G——n, had given new vigor and impulse; and thus the\n      conversation, during the greater part of the night, had run wild upon the\n      all-engrossing topic of the times. The Baron, who had been unusually\n      silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening, at length\n      seemed to be aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the\n      discourse, and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the\n      beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an\n      ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner,\n      which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general, and\n      absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be at heart a\n      ridiculer of those very points for which he contended, and especially to\n      hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign\n      contempt which it deserves.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse (of which\n      my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it bore resemblance\n      to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical sermonic manner of\n      Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest\n      in the countenance of one of the party. This gentleman, whom I shall call\n      Hermann, was an original in every respect—except, perhaps, in the\n      single particular that he was a very great fool. He contrived to bear,\n      however, among a particular set at the university, a reputation for deep\n      metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some logical talent. As a\n      duellist he had acquired great renown, even at G——n. I forget\n      the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands; but they were\n      many. He was a man of courage undoubtedly. But it was upon his minute\n      acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his\n      sense of honor, that he most especially prided himself. These things were\n      a hobby which he rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for\n      the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food\n      for mystification. Of this, however, I was not aware; although, in the\n      present instance, I saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was\n      upon the tapis with my friend, and that Hermann was its especial object.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue, I perceived\n      the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At length he spoke;\n      offering some objection to a point insisted upon by R., and giving his\n      reasons in detail. To these the Baron replied at length (still maintaining\n      his exaggerated tone of sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very\n      bad taste, with a sarcasm and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the\n      bit in his teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting\n      farrago of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember. “Your\n      opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the main correct,\n      are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself and to the university\n      of which you are a member. In a few respects they are even unworthy of\n      serious refutation. I would say more than this, sir, were it not for the\n      fear of giving you offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), I would say,\n      sir, that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a\n      gentleman.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were turned upon\n      the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red; then, dropping his\n      pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it, when I caught a glimpse of\n      his countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table. It\n      was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural\n      character, but which I had never seen it assume except when we were alone\n      together, and when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he\n      stood erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of\n      countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before. For a\n      moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and that he was in\n      sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face was\n      cadaverously white. For a short time he remained silent, apparently\n      striving to master his emotion. Having at length seemingly succeeded, he\n      reached a decanter which stood near him, saying as he held it firmly\n      clenched—“The language you have thought proper to employ,\n      Mynheer Hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so\n      many particulars, that I have neither temper nor time for specification.\n      That my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be expected from a\n      gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one\n      line of conduct. Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence of\n      this company, and to yourself, at this moment, as my guest. You will\n      pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I deviate slightly\n      from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal\n      affront. You will forgive me for the moderate tax I shall make upon your\n      imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of\n      your person in yonder mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself. This\n      being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. I shall discharge this\n      decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil all the\n      spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your insult, while the\n      necessity of physical violence to your real person will be\n      obviated.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against the mirror\n      which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the reflection of his\n      person with great precision, and of course shattering the glass into\n      fragments. The whole company at once started to their feet, and, with the\n      exception of myself and Ritzner, took their departure. As Hermann went\n      out, the Baron whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of\n      my services. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of so\n      ridiculous a piece of business.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and <i>ultra recherché</i> air, and,\n      taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could hardly forbear laughing in\n      his face while he proceeded to discuss, with the profoundest gravity, what\n      he termed “the refinedly peculiar character” of the insult he had\n      received. After a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style, he took down\n      from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the\n      duello, and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading\n      aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remember the titles\n      of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance of Philip le Bel on\n      Single Combat”; the “Theatre of Honor,” by Favyn, and a treatise “On the\n      Permission of Duels,” by Andiguier. He displayed, also, with much\n      pomposity, Brantome’s “Memoirs of Duels,” published at Cologne,\n      1666, in the types of Elzevir—a precious and unique vellum-paper\n      volume, with a fine margin, and bound by Derome. But he requested my\n      attention particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick\n      octavo, written in barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman, and having\n      the quaint title, “Duelli Lex Scripta, et non; aliterque.” From this he\n      read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning “Injuriae per\n      applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,” about half of which, he\n      averred, was strictly applicable to his own “refinedly peculiar” case,\n      although not one syllable of the whole matter could I understand for the\n      life of me. Having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded\n      what I thought necessary to be done. I replied that I had entire\n      confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would abide by what he\n      proposed. With this answer he seemed flattered, and sat down to write a\n      note to the Baron. It ran thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n      Sir,—My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note. I find it incumbent\n      upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an explanation of this\n      evening’s occurrences at your chambers. In the event of your declining\n      this request, Mr. P. will be happy to arrange, with any friend whom you\n      may appoint, the steps preliminary to a meeting.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With sentiments of perfect respect,\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      Your most humble servant,<br>\n      J<small>OHANN</small> H<small>ERMAN</small>.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n      “<i>To the Baron Ritzner von Jung,<br>\n      August 18th, 18</i>—.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with this epistle. He\n      bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave countenance, motioned me to a\n      seat. Having perused the cartel, he wrote the following reply, which I\n      carried to Hermann.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “S<small>IR</small>,—Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your note of\n      this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the propriety of the\n      explanation you suggest. This being admitted, I still find great\n      difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement,\n      and of the personal affront offered on my part,) in so wording what I have\n      to say by way of apology, as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all\n      the variable shadows, of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that\n      extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules\n      of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so pre-eminently\n      distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore, of being comprehended, I\n      beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own, to refer you to\n      the opinions of Sieur Hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the\n      chapter of “<i>Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se</i>,” in\n      his “<i>Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque</i>.” The nicety of your\n      discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient, I am\n      assured, to convince you <i>that the mere circumstance of me referring you</i> to\n      this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor,\n      for explanation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “With sentiments of profound respect,\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      “Your most obedient servant,<br>\n      “V<small>ON</small> J<small>UNG</small>.”\n    </p>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n      “The Herr Johann Hermann,<br>\n      August 18th, 18—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, which,\n      however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-complacency\n      as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per applicationem, per\n      constructionem, et per se. Having finished reading, he begged me, with the\n      blandest of all possible smiles, to be seated, while he made reference to\n      the treatise in question. Turning to the passage specified, he read it\n      with great care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my\n      character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron von Jung\n      his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in that of second, to\n      assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most\n      honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron. He seemed to\n      receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of course, and after a few\n      words of general conversation, went to an inner room and brought out the\n      everlasting treatise “<i>Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque</i>.” He handed me\n      the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to\n      little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning. He\n      then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. To my surprise,\n      what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between\n      two baboons. He now explained the mystery; showing that the volume, as it\n      appeared <i>prima facie</i>, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of\n      Du Bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to\n      present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and even of\n      profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed. The key to the\n      whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately,\n      when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as\n      practised in modern times.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise\n      in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before the adventure, and that he was\n      satisfied, from the general tenor of his conversation, that he had studied\n      it with the deepest attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of\n      unusual merit. Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have died a\n      thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand\n      anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about\n      the <i>duello</i>.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.10\"></a>DIDDLING</h2>\n<h3>CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE EXACT SCIENCES.</h3>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Hey, diddle diddle<br>\n      The cat and the fiddle\n</p>\n<p>\n      Since the world began there have been two Jeremys. The one wrote a\n      Jeremiad about usury, and was called Jeremy Bentham. He has been much\n      admired by Mr. John Neal, and was a great man in a small way. The other\n      gave name to the most important of the Exact Sciences, and was a great man\n      in a great way—I may say, indeed, in the very greatest of ways.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Diddling—or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle—is\n      sufficiently well understood. Yet the fact, the deed, the thing <i>diddling</i>,\n      is somewhat difficult to define. We may get, however, at a tolerably\n      distinct conception of the matter in hand, by defining—not the\n      thing, diddling, in itself—but man, as an animal that diddles. Had\n      Plato but hit upon this, he would have been spared the affront of the\n      picked chicken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken, which was\n      clearly “a biped without feathers,” was not, according to his own\n      definition, a man? But I am not to be bothered by any similar query. Man\n      is an animal that diddles, and there is no animal that diddles but man. It\n      will take an entire hen-coop of picked chickens to get over that.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling is, in\n      fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons. A\n      crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles. To diddle is\n      his destiny. “Man was made to mourn,” says the poet. But not so:—he\n      was made to diddle. This is his aim—his object—his end. And\n      for this reason when a man’s diddled we say he’s “<i>done</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the ingredients are\n      minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity, audacity, <i>nonchalance</i>,\n      originality, impertinence, and grin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Minuteness:</i>—Your diddler is minute. His operations are upon a small\n      scale. His business is retail, for cash, or approved paper at sight.\n      Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation, he then, at once,\n      loses his distinctive features, and becomes what we term “financier.” This\n      latter word conveys the diddling idea in every respect except that of\n      magnitude. A diddler may thus be regarded as a banker <i>in petto</i>—a\n      “financial operation,” as a diddle at Brobdignag. The one is to the other,\n      as Homer to “Flaccus”—as a Mastodon to a mouse—as the tail of\n      a comet to that of a pig.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Interest:</i>—Your diddler is guided by self-interest. He scorns to\n      diddle for the mere <i>sake</i> of the diddle. He has an object in view—his\n      pocket—and yours. He regards always the main chance. He looks to\n      Number One. You are Number Two, and must look to yourself.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Perseverance:</i>—Your diddler perseveres. He is not readily\n      discouraged. Should even the banks break, he cares nothing about it. He\n      steadily pursues his end, and\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      ‘Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto,’\n    </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      so he never lets go of his game.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Ingenuity:</i>—Your diddler is ingenious. He has constructiveness large.\n      He understands plot. He invents and circumvents. Were he not Alexander he\n      would be Diogenes. Were he not a diddler, he would be a maker of patent\n      rat-traps or an angler for trout.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Audacity:</i>—Your diddler is audacious.—He is a bold man. He\n      carries the war into Africa. He conquers all by assault. He would not fear\n      the daggers of Frey Herren. With a little more prudence Dick Turpin would\n      have made a good diddler; with a trifle less blarney, Daniel O’Connell;\n      with a pound or two more brains, Charles the Twelfth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Nonchalance:</i>—Your diddler is nonchalant. He is not at all nervous.\n      He never had any nerves. He is never seduced into a flurry. He is never\n      put out—unless put out of doors. He is cool—cool as a\n      cucumber. He is calm—“calm as a smile from Lady Bury.” He is easy—easy\n      as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient Baiæ.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Originality:</i>—Your diddler is original—conscientiously so. His\n      thoughts are his own. He would scorn to employ those of another. A stale\n      trick is his aversion. He would return a purse, I am sure, upon\n      discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal diddle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Impertinence:</i>—Your diddler is impertinent. He swaggers. He sets his\n      arms a-kimbo. He thrusts his hands in his trowsers’ pockets. He sneers in\n      your face. He treads on your corns. He eats your dinner, he drinks your\n      wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your nose, he kicks your poodle, and\n      he kisses your wife.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Grin:</i>—Your true diddler winds up all with a grin. But this nobody\n      sees but himself. He grins when his daily work is done—when his\n      allotted labors are accomplished—at night in his own closet, and\n      altogether for his own private entertainment. He goes home. He locks his\n      door. He divests himself of his clothes. He puts out his candle. He gets\n      into bed. He places his head upon the pillow. All this done, and your\n      diddler grins. This is no hypothesis. It is a matter of course. I reason <i>à\n      priori</i>, and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the Human Race.\n      Perhaps the first diddler was Adam. At all events, we can trace the\n      science back to a very remote period of antiquity. The moderns, however,\n      have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our thick-headed\n      progenitors. Without pausing to speak of the “old saws,” therefore, I\n      shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more\n      “modern instances.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      A very good diddle is this. A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for instance,\n      is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses. At length she\n      arrives at one offering an excellent variety. She is accosted, and invited\n      to enter, by a polite and voluble individual at the door. She finds a sofa\n      well adapted to her views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and\n      delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent. lower than her\n      expectations. She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and receipt,\n      leaves her address, with a request that the article be sent home as\n      speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion of bows from the\n      shopkeeper. The night arrives and no sofa. A servant is sent to make\n      inquiry about the delay. The whole transaction is denied. No sofa has been\n      sold—no money received—except by the diddler, who played\n      shop-keeper for the nonce.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus afford every\n      facility for a trick of this kind. Visitors enter, look at furniture, and\n      depart unheeded and unseen. Should any one wish to purchase, or to inquire\n      the price of an article, a bell is at hand, and this is considered amply\n      sufficient.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Again, quite a respectable diddle is this. A well-dressed individual\n      enters a shop, makes a purchase to the value of a dollar; finds, much to\n      his vexation, that he has left his pocket-book in another coat pocket; and\n      so says to the shopkeeper—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending the bundle\n      home? But stay! I really believe that I have nothing less than a five\n      dollar bill, even there. However, you can send four dollars in change with\n      the bundle, you know.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Very good, sir,” replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at once, a\n      lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. “I know fellows,” he\n      says to himself, “who would just have put the goods under their arm, and\n      walked off with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in\n      the afternoon.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      A boy is sent with the parcel and change. On the route, quite\n      accidentally, he is met by the purchaser, who exclaims:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah! This is my bundle, I see—I thought you had been home with it,\n      long ago. Well, go on! My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you the five\n      dollars—I left instructions with her to that effect. The change you\n      might as well give to me—I shall want some silver for the Post\n      Office. Very good! One, two, is this a good quarter?—three, four—quite\n      right! Say to Mrs. Trotter that you met me, and be sure now and do not\n      loiter on the way.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The boy doesn’t loiter at all—but he is a very long time in getting\n      back from his errand—for no lady of the precise name of Mrs. Trotter\n      is to be discovered. He consoles himself, however, that he has not been\n      such a fool as to leave the goods without the money, and re-entering his\n      shop with a self-satisfied air, feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his\n      master asks him what has become of the change.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A very simple diddle, indeed, is this. The captain of a ship, which is\n      about to sail, is presented by an official looking person with an\n      unusually moderate bill of city charges. Glad to get off so easily, and\n      confused by a hundred duties pressing upon him all at once, he discharges\n      the claim forthwith. In about fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable\n      bill is handed him by one who soon makes it evident that the first\n      collector was a diddler, and the original collection a diddle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. A steamboat is casting loose\n      from the wharf. A traveller, portmanteau in hand, is discovered running\n      toward the wharf, at full speed. Suddenly, he makes a dead halt, stoops,\n      and picks up something from the ground in a very agitated manner. It is a\n      pocket-book, and—“Has any gentleman lost a pocketbook?” he cries. No\n      one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement\n      ensues, when the treasure trove is found to be of value. The boat,\n      however, must not be detained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Time and tide wait for no man,” says the captain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “For God’s sake, stay only a few minutes,” says the finder of the book—“the\n      true claimant will presently appear.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Can’t wait!” replies the man in authority; “cast off there, d’ye hear?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What <i>am</i> I to do?” asks the finder, in great tribulation. “I am about to\n      leave the country for some years, and I cannot conscientiously retain this\n      large amount in my possession. I beg your pardon, sir,” [here he addresses\n      a gentleman on shore,] “but you have the air of an honest man. <i>Will</i> you\n      confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocket-book—I <i>know</i>\n      I can trust you—and of advertising it? The notes, you see, amount to\n      a very considerable sum. The owner will, no doubt, insist upon rewarding\n      you for your trouble—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Me!</i>—no, <i>you!</i>—it was you who found the book.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, if you <i>must</i> have it so—<i>I</i> will take a small reward—just\n      to satisfy your scruples. Let me see—why these notes are all\n      hundreds—bless my soul! a hundred is too much to take—fifty\n      would be quite enough, I am sure—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Cast off there!” says the captain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But then I have no change for a hundred, and upon the whole, <i>you</i> had\n      better—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Cast off there!” says the captain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Never mind!” cries the gentleman on shore, who has been examining his own\n      pocket-book for the last minute or so—“never mind! <i>I</i> can fix it—here\n      is a fifty on the Bank of North America—throw the book.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked reluctance,\n      and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while the steamboat fumes\n      and fizzes on her way. In about half an hour after her departure, the\n      “large amount” is seen to be a “counterfeit presentment,” and the whole\n      thing a capital diddle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A bold diddle is this. A camp-meeting, or something similar, is to be held\n      at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge. A\n      diddler stations himself upon this bridge, respectfully informs all\n      passers by of the new county law, which establishes a toll of one cent for\n      foot passengers, two for horses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth.\n      Some grumble but all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by\n      some fifty or sixty dollars well earned. This taking a toll from a great\n      crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A neat diddle is this. A friend holds one of the diddler’s promises to\n      pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the ordinary blanks printed in\n      red ink. The diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks, and every\n      day dips one of them in his soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally\n      gives it to him as a bonne bouche. The note arriving at maturity, the\n      diddler, with the diddler’s dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to\n      pay is made the topic of discussion. The friend produces it from his\n      escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when up jumps\n      the diddler’s dog and devours it forthwith. The diddler is not only\n      surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog, and\n      expresses his entire readiness to cancel the obligation at any moment when\n      the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A very mean diddle is this. A lady is insulted in the street by a\n      diddler’s accomplice. The diddler himself flies to her assistance, and,\n      giving his friend a comfortable thrashing, insists upon attending the lady\n      to her own door. He bows, with his hand upon his heart, and most\n      respectfully bids her adieu. She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk\n      in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa. With a sigh, he\n      declines to do so. “Is there no way, then, sir,” she murmurs, “in which I\n      may be permitted to testify my gratitude?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, yes, madam, there is. Will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of\n      shillings?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon fainting\n      outright. Upon second thought, however, she opens her purse-strings and\n      delivers the specie. Now this, I say, is a diddle minute—for one\n      entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had\n      the trouble of performing the insult, and who had then to stand still and\n      be thrashed for performing it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this. The diddler\n      approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of tobacco.\n      These are handed to him, when, having slightly examined them, he says:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I don’t much like this tobacco. Here, take it back, and give me a glass\n      of brandy and water in its place.” The brandy and water is furnished and\n      imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the door. But the voice of the\n      tavern-keeper arrests him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Pay for my brandy and water!—didn’t I give you the tobacco for the\n      brandy and water? What more would you have?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But, sir, if you please, I don’t remember that you paid me for the\n      tobacco.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “What do you mean by that, you scoundrel?—Didn’t I give you back\n      your tobacco? Isn’t that your tobacco lying there? Do you expect me to pay\n      for what I did not take?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But, sir,” says the publican, now rather at a loss what to say, “but\n      sir—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But me no buts, sir,” interrupts the diddler, apparently in very high\n      dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his escape.—“But\n      me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon travellers.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is not its\n      least recommendation. A purse, or pocket-book, being really lost, the\n      loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a large city a fully\n      descriptive advertisement.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement, with a\n      change of heading, of general phraseology and address. The original, for\n      instance, is long, and verbose, is headed “A Pocket-Book Lost!” and\n      requires the treasure, when found, to be left at No. 1 Tom Street. The\n      copy is brief, and being headed with “Lost” only, indicates No. 2 Dick, or\n      No. 3 Harry Street, as the locality at which the owner may be seen.\n      Moreover, it is inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of\n      the day, while in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours\n      after the original. Should it be read by the loser of the purse, he would\n      hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own misfortune. But, of\n      course, the chances are five or six to one, that the finder will repair to\n      the address given by the diddler, rather than to that pointed out by the\n      rightful proprietor. The former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and\n      decamps.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Quite an analogous diddle is this. A lady of ton has dropped, some where\n      in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value. For its recovery, she\n      offers some forty or fifty dollars reward—giving, in her\n      advertisement, a very minute description of the gem, and of its settings,\n      and declaring that, on its restoration at No. so and so, in such and such\n      Avenue, the reward would be paid instanter, without a single question\n      being asked. During the lady’s absence from home, a day or two afterwards,\n      a ring is heard at the door of No. so and so, in such and such Avenue; a\n      servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and is declared to be\n      out, at which astounding information, the visitor expresses the most\n      poignant regret. His business is of importance and concerns the lady\n      herself. In fact, he had the good fortune to find her diamond ring. But\n      perhaps it would be as well that he should call again. “By no means!” says\n      the servant; and “By no means!” says the lady’s sister and the lady’s\n      sister-in-law, who are summoned forthwith. The ring is clamorously\n      identified, the reward is paid, and the finder nearly thrust out of doors.\n      The lady returns and expresses some little dissatisfaction with her sister\n      and sister-in-law, because they happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars\n      for a fac-simile of her diamond ring—a fac-simile made out of real\n      pinch-beck and unquestionable paste.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none to this\n      essay, were I even to hint at half the variations, or inflections, of\n      which this science is susceptible. I must bring this paper, perforce, to a\n      conclusion, and this I cannot do better than by a summary notice of a very\n      decent, but rather elaborate diddle, of which our own city was made the\n      theatre, not very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with\n      success, in other still more verdant localities of the Union. A\n      middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown. He is remarkably\n      precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his demeanor. His dress is\n      scrupulously neat, but plain, unostentatious. He wears a white cravat, an\n      ample waistcoat, made with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled\n      cosy-looking shoes, and pantaloons without straps. He has the whole air,\n      in fact, of your well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable “man of\n      business,” <i>par excellence</i>—one of the stern and outwardly hard,\n      internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high comedies—fellows\n      whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted for giving away guineas,\n      in charity, with the one hand, while, in the way of mere bargain, they\n      exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing with the other.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house. He\n      dislikes children. He has been accustomed to quiet. His habits are\n      methodical—and then he would prefer getting into a private and\n      respectable small family, piously inclined. Terms, however, are no object—only\n      he must insist upon settling his bill on the first of every month, (it is\n      now the second) and begs his landlady, when he finally obtains one to his\n      mind, not on any account to forget his instructions upon this point—but\n      to send in a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o’clock, on the first day\n      of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the second.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a\n      reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town. There is nothing\n      he more despises than pretense. “Where there is much show,” he says,\n      “there is seldom any thing very solid behind”—an observation which\n      so profoundly impresses his landlady’s fancy, that she makes a pencil\n      memorandum of it forthwith, in her great family Bible, on the broad margin\n      of the Proverbs of Solomon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this, in the\n      principal business six-pennies of the city—the pennies are eschewed\n      as not “respectable”—and as demanding payment for all advertisements\n      in advance. Our man of business holds it as a point of his faith that work\n      should never be paid for until done.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “W<small>ANTED</small>.—The advertisers, being about to\n      commence extensive business operations in this city, will require the\n      services of three or four intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a\n      liberal salary will be paid. The very best recommendations, not so much\n      for capacity, as for integrity, will be expected. Indeed, as the duties\n      to be performed involve high responsibilities, and large amounts of money\n      must necessarily pass through the hands of those engaged, it is deemed\n      advisable to demand a deposit of fifty dollars from each clerk employed.\n      No person need apply, therefore, who is not prepared to leave this sum in\n      the possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most\n      satisfactory testimonials of morality.

But our man of business is in\n      no hurry to conclude a contract with any—no man of business is ever\n      precipitate—and it is not until the most rigid catechism in respect\n      to the piety of each young gentleman’s inclination, that his services are\n      engaged and his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper\n      precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of Bogs, Hogs, Logs,\n      Frogs, and Company. On the morning of the first day of the next month, the\n      landlady does not present her bill, according to promise—a piece of\n      neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in ogs would no\n      doubt have chided her severely, could he have been prevailed upon to\n      remain in town a day or two for that purpose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running hither and\n      thither, and all they can do is to declare the man of business most\n      emphatically, a “hen knee high”—by which some persons imagine them\n      to imply that, in fact, he is n. e. i.—by which again the very\n      classical phrase <i>non est inventus</i>, is supposed to be understood. In the\n      meantime the young gentlemen, one and all, are somewhat less piously\n      inclined than before, while the landlady purchases a shilling’s worth of\n      the Indian rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum\n      that some fool has made in her great family Bible, on the broad margin of\n      the Proverbs of Solomon.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.11\"></a>THE ANGEL OF THE ODD</h2>\n<h3>AN EXTRAVAGANZA.</h3>\n<p>\n      It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an unusually\n      hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic <i>truffe</i> formed not the least\n      important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet\n      upon the fender, and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to\n      the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some\n      miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit and <i>liqueur</i>. In the morning I\n      had been reading Glover’s “Leonidas,” Wilkie’s “Epigoniad,” Lamartine’s\n      “Pilgrimage,” Barlow’s “Columbiad,” Tuckermann’s “Sicily,” and Griswold’s\n      “Curiosities”; I am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a\n      little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent Lafitte,\n      and, all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair. Having\n      carefully perused the column of “houses to let,” and the column of “dogs\n      lost,” and then the two columns of “wives and apprentices runaway,” I\n      attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from\n      beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the\n      possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the\n      beginning, but with no more satisfactory result. I was about throwing\n      away, in disgust,\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     “This folio of four pages, happy work<br>\n     Which not even critics criticise,”\n</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper mentions\n      the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was playing at ‘puff the\n      dart,’ which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and\n      blown at a target through a tin tube. He placed the needle at the wrong\n      end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward\n      with force, drew the needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in\n      a few days killed him.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why.\n      “This thing,” I exclaimed, “is a contemptible falsehood—a poor hoax—the\n      lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner—of some\n      wretched concoctor of accidents in Cocaigne. These fellows, knowing the\n      extravagant gullibility of the age, set their wits to work in the\n      imagination of improbable possibilities—-of odd accidents, as they\n      term them; but to a reflecting intellect (like mine,” I added, in\n      parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose,)\n      “to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems\n      evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ‘odd\n      accidents’ is by far the oddest accident of all. For my own part, I intend\n      to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the ‘singular’ about\n      it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of the most\n      remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a rumbling in my\n      ears—such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk—but,\n      upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling that\n      which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact,\n      this I should have concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the\n      syllables and words. I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few\n      glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no little, so\n      that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a\n      leisurely movement, and looked carefully around the room for the intruder.\n      I could not, however, perceive any one at all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Humph!” resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, “you mus pe so dronk\n      as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your zide.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there,\n      sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript,\n      although not altogether indescribable. His body was a wine-pipe, or a\n      rum-puncheon, or something of that character, and had a truly Falstaffian\n      air. In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to\n      answer all the purposes of legs. For arms there dangled from the upper\n      portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward\n      for hands. All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was one of\n      those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the\n      middle of the lid. This canteen (with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier\n      cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the\n      hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like\n      the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain\n      rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible\n      talk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee me\n      zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to\n      dispelief vat iz print in de print. ’Tiz de troof—dat it iz—eberry\n      vord ob it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Who are you, pray?” said I, with much dignity, although somewhat puzzled;\n      “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking about?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Az vor ow I com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your\n      pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat I tink\n      proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com’d here for to\n      let you zee for yourzelf.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You are a drunken vagabond,” said I, “and I shall ring the bell and order\n      my footman to kick you into the street.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “He! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Can’t do!” said I, “what do you mean?—I can’t do what?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ring de pell,” he replied, attempting a grin with his little villanous\n      mouth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat into\n      execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table very\n      deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of\n      the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which I had half\n      arisen. I was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss\n      what to do. In the meantime, he continued his talk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall know\n      who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te <i>Angel ov te Odd</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And odd enough, too,” I ventured to reply; “but I was always under the\n      impression that an angel had wings.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat I pe do mit te wing? Mein Gott!\n      do you take me vor a shicken?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No—oh no!” I replied, much alarmed, “you are no chicken—certainly\n      not.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I’ll rap you again mid me\n      vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing, und te imp ab te\n      wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel ab <i>not</i> te wing, and\n      I am te <i>Angel ov te Odd</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And your business with me at present is—is—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My pizzness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low bred buppy you mos pe\n      vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel; so,\n      plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach, and\n      hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either he dodged, however, or my\n      aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of the\n      crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece. As\n      for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or\n      three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. These reduced me\n      at once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that either\n      through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mein Gott!” said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my\n      distress; “mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry. You mos\n      not trink it so strong—you mos put te water in te wine. Here, trink\n      dis, like a goot veller, und don’t gry now—don’t!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was about a\n      third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his\n      hand bottles. I observed that these bottles had labels about their necks,\n      and that these labels were inscribed “Kirschenwasser.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little measure;\n      and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port more than once, I at\n      length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary\n      discourse. I cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but I gleaned\n      from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the <i>contretemps</i>\n      of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the <i>odd accidents</i>\n      which are continually astonishing the skeptic. Once or twice, upon my\n      venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions,\n      he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I considered it the wiser\n      policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way. He talked on,\n      therefore, at great length, while I merely leaned back in my chair with my\n      eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems\n      about the room. But, by and by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior\n      of mine into contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel\n      down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character\n      which I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and\n      departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, “<i>beaucoup\n      de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      His departure afforded me relief. The <i>very</i> few glasses of Lafitte\n      that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt\n      inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom\n      after dinner. At six I had an appointment of consequence, which it was\n      quite indispensable that I should keep. The policy of insurance for my\n      dwelling house had expired the day before; and, some dispute having\n      arisen, it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors\n      of the company and settle the terms of a renewal. Glancing upward at the\n      clock on the mantel-piece, (for I felt too drowsy to take out my watch), I\n      had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five minutes to spare. It\n      was half past five; I could easily walk to the insurance office in five\n      minutes; and my usual siestas had never been known to exceed five and\n      twenty. I felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and composed myself to my\n      slumbers forthwith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the\n      time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd\n      accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty\n      minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted seven and\n      twenty of the appointed hour. I betook myself again to my nap, and at\n      length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it <i>still</i>\n      wanted twenty-seven minutes of six. I jumped up to examine the clock, and\n      found that it had ceased running. My watch informed me that it was half\n      past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for my\n      appointment. “It will make no difference,” I said: “I can call at the\n      office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the\n      matter with the clock?” Upon examining it I discovered that one of the\n      raisin stems which I had been filliping about the room during the\n      discourse of the Angel of the Odd, had flown through the fractured\n      crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the key-hole, with an end\n      projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute hand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ah!” said I, “I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A natural\n      accident, such as <i>will</i> happen now and then!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour retired\n      to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head,\n      and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the “Omnipresence of\n      the Deity,” I unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds,\n      leaving the light burning as it was.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the Odd.\n      Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the curtains, and,\n      in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum puncheon, menaced me with the\n      bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I had treated him. He\n      concluded a long harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube\n      into my gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwässer,\n      which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long necked\n      bottles that stood him instead of an arm. My agony was at length\n      insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off\n      with the lighted candle from the stand, but <i>not</i> in season to\n      prevent his making his escape with it through the hole. Very soon, a\n      strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, I clearly\n      perceived, was on fire. In a few minutes the blaze broke forth with\n      violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was\n      wrapped in flames. All egress from my chamber, except through a window,\n      was cut off. The crowd, however, quickly procured and raised a long\n      ladder. By means of this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety,\n      when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole\n      air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the Angel of\n      the Odd,—when this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly\n      slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left\n      shoulder needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing-post\n      than that afforded by the foot of the ladder. In an instant I was\n      precipitated and had the misfortune to fracture my arm.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious\n      loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the fire,\n      predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, I made up my mind\n      to take a wife. There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her\n      seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows.\n      She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers. I knelt at her feet in\n      gratitude and adoration. She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into\n      close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean. I know\n      not how the entanglement took place, but so it was. I arose with a shining\n      pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath, half buried in alien hair. Thus\n      ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been\n      anticipated, to be sure, but which the natural sequence of events had\n      brought about.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less implacable\n      heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief period; but again a\n      trivial incident interfered. Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged\n      with the <i>élite</i> of the city, I was hastening to greet her with one\n      of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter,\n      lodging in the corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely\n      blind. Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had\n      disappeared—irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my\n      premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. While I stood\n      bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might have happened,\n      nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still continued\n      incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd, who proffered\n      me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to expect. He examined my\n      disordered eye with much gentleness and skill, informed me that I had a\n      drop in it, and (whatever a “drop” was) took it out, and afforded me\n      relief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so determined to\n      persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the nearest river. Here,\n      divesting myself of my clothes, (for there is no reason why we cannot die\n      as we were born), I threw myself headlong into the current; the sole\n      witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the\n      eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his\n      fellows. No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it into its\n      head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel.\n      Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I just slipped\n      my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a\n      pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and\n      its circumstances would admit. But my evil destiny attended me still. As I\n      ran at full speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon\n      the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no\n      longer upon <i>terra-firma</i>; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a\n      precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my\n      good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which depended from\n      a passing balloon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific\n      predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted all the power of my\n      lungs to make that predicament known to the æronaut overhead. But for a\n      long time I exerted myself in vain. Either the fool could not, or the\n      villain would not perceive me. Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while\n      my strength even more rapidly failed. I was soon upon the point of\n      resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my\n      spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which\n      seemed to be lazily humming an opera air. Looking up, I perceived the\n      Angel of the Odd. He was leaning with his arms folded, over the rim of the\n      car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he puffed leisurely, seemed to\n      be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe. I was too much\n      exhausted to speak, so I merely regarded him with an imploring air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said\n      nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the\n      left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      To this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, I could reply only by\n      ejaculating the monosyllable “Help!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Elp!” echoed the ruffian—“not I. Dare iz te pottle—elp\n      yourself, und pe tam’d!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which,\n      dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that my\n      brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with this idea, I was about to\n      relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when I was\n      arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Old on!” he said; “don’t pe in te urry—don’t. Will you pe take de\n      odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your zenzes?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice—once in the negative,\n      meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at present—and\n      once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I <i>was</i> sober\n      and <i>had</i> positively come to my senses. By these means I somewhat\n      softened the Angel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? You pelief, ten, in te\n      possibilty of te odd?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I again nodded my head in assent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Und you ave pelief in <i>me</i>, te Angel of te Odd?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I nodded again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I nodded once more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in token ov\n      your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible to do.\n      In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the\n      ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand, I must\n      have let go altogether. In the second place, I could have no breeches\n      until I came across the crow. I was therefore obliged, much to my regret,\n      to shake my head in the negative—intending thus to give the Angel to\n      understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply\n      with his very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking\n      my head than—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the Angel of the Odd.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the guide-rope by\n      which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over my own\n      house, (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely rebuilt,) it\n      so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon\n      the dining-room hearth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me,) I\n      found it about four o’clock in the morning. I lay outstretched where I had\n      fallen from the balloon. My head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished\n      fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown,\n      and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a\n      newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of\n      the Schiedam Kirschenwasser. Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      [Mabbott states that Griswold “obviously had a revised form” for use in\n      the 1856 volume of Poe’s works. Mabbott does not substantiate this claim,\n      but it is surely not unreasonable. An editor, and even typographical\n      errors, may have produced nearly all of the very minor changes made in\n      this version. (Indeed, two very necessary words were clearly dropped by\n      accident.) An editor might have corrected “Wickliffe’s ‘Epigoniad’” to\n      “Wilkie’s ‘Epigoniad’,” but is unlikely to have added “Tuckerman’s\n      ‘Sicily’” to the list of books read by the narrator. Griswold was not\n      above forgery (in Poe’s letters) when it suited his purpose, but would\n      have too little to gain by such an effort in this instance.]\n    </p>\n",

It is a translation, by my friend, Martin Van Buren Mavis,\n      (sometimes called the “Poughkeepsie Seer”) of an odd-looking MS. which I\n      found, about a year ago, tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare\n      Tenebrarum—a sea well described by the Nubian geographer, but seldom\n      visited now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for\n      crotchets.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Truly yours,\n    </p>\n<p>\n      EDGAR A. POE\n    </p>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n{this paragraph not in the volume—ED}\n</p>\n<h3>ON BOARD BALLOON “SKYLARK”</h3>\n<p class=\"right\">\n<i>April</i>, 1, 2848\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now, my dear friend—now, for your sins, you are to suffer the\n      infliction of a long gossiping letter. I tell you distinctly that I am\n      going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as tedious, as\n      discursive, as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as possible. Besides, here\n      I am, cooped up in a dirty balloon, with some one or two hundred of the\n      canaille, all bound on a pleasure excursion, (what a funny idea some\n      people have of pleasure!) and I have no prospect of touching terra firma\n      for a month at least. Nobody to talk to. Nothing to do. When one has\n      nothing to do, then is the time to correspond with ones friends. You\n      perceive, then, why it is that I write you this letter—it is on\n      account of my ennui and your sins.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed. I mean to\n      write at you every day during this odious voyage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Heigho! when will any Invention visit the human pericranium? Are we\n      forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the balloon? Will\n      nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of progress? The jog-trot\n      movement, to my thinking, is little less than positive torture. Upon my\n      word we have not made more than a hundred miles the hour since leaving\n      home! The very birds beat us—at least some of them. I assure you\n      that I do not exaggerate at all. Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than\n      it actually is—this on account of our having no objects about us by\n      which to estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind.\n      To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our\n      rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so very bad. Accustomed as I\n      am to this mode of travelling, I cannot get over a kind of giddiness\n      whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead. It always\n      seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry\n      us off in its claws. One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so\n      nearly overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network suspending\n      our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. Our captain said that if\n      the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished “silk” of five\n      hundred or a thousand years ago, we should inevitably have been damaged.\n      This silk, as he explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails\n      of a species of earth-worm. The worm was carefully fed on mulberries—a kind\n      of fruit resembling a water-melon—and, when sufficiently fat, was\n      crushed in a mill. The paste thus arising was called papyrus in its\n      primary state, and went through a variety of processes until it finally\n      became “silk.” Singular to relate, it was once much admired as an article\n      of female dress! Balloons were also very generally constructed from it. A\n      better kind of material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down\n      surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called euphorbium, and at\n      that time botanically termed milk-weed. This latter kind of silk was\n      designated as silk-buckingham, on account of its superior durability, and\n      was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum\n      caoutchouc—a substance which in some respects must have resembled\n      the gutta percha now in common use. This caoutchouc was occasionally\n      called Indian rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the\n      numerous fungi. Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Talking of drag-ropes—our own, it seems, has this moment knocked a\n      man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that swarm in\n      ocean below us—a boat of about six thousand tons, and, from all\n      accounts, shamefully crowded. These diminutive barques should be\n      prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of passengers. The\n      man, of course, was not permitted to get on board again, and was soon out\n      of sight, he and his life-preserver. I rejoice, my dear friend, that we\n      live in an age so enlightened that no such a thing as an individual is\n      supposed to exist. It is the mass for which the true Humanity cares.\n      By-the-by, talking of Humanity, do you know that our immortal Wiggins is\n      not so original in his views of the Social Condition and so forth, as his\n      contemporaries are inclined to suppose? Pundit assures me that the same\n      ideas were put nearly in the same way, about a thousand years ago, by an\n      Irish philosopher called Furrier, on account of his keeping a retail shop\n      for cat peltries and other furs. Pundit knows, you know; there can be no\n      mistake about it. How very wonderfully do we see verified every day, the\n      profound observation of the Hindoo Aries Tottle (as quoted by Pundit)—“Thus\n      must we say that, not once or twice, or a few times, but with almost\n      infinite repetitions, the same opinions come round in a circle among men.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      April 2.—Spoke to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle\n      section of floating telegraph wires. I learn that when this species of\n      telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it was considered quite\n      impossible to convey the wires over sea, but now we are at a loss to\n      comprehend where the difficulty lay! So wags the world. Tempora mutantur—excuse\n      me for quoting the Etruscan. What would we do without the Atalantic\n      telegraph? (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a\n      few minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among other\n      glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while the plague is\n      doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and Ayesher. Is it not\n      truly remarkable that, before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy\n      by Humanity, the world was accustomed to regard War and Pestilence as\n      calamities? Do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the\n      ancient temples to the end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon\n      mankind? Is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of\n      interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to perceive that\n      the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive\n      advantage to the mass!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      April 3.—It is really a very fine amusement to ascend the\n      rope-ladder leading to the summit of the balloon-bag, and thence survey\n      the surrounding world. From the car below you know the prospect is not so\n      comprehensive—you can see little vertically. But seated here (where\n      I write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned open piazza of the summit, one\n      can see everything that is going on in all directions. Just now there is\n      quite a crowd of balloons in sight, and they present a very animated\n      appearance, while the air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of\n      human voices. I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or (Pundit will\n      have it) Violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut,\n      maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all\n      directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable current\n      was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his contemporaries,\n      who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort of madman, because the\n      philosophers (?) of the day declared the thing impossible. Really now it\n      does seem to me quite unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible\n      could have escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans. But in all ages the\n      great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the so-called\n      men of science. To be sure, our men of science are not quite so bigoted as\n      those of old:—oh, I have something so queer to tell you on this\n      topic. Do you know that it is not more than a thousand years ago since the\n      metaphysicians consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that\n      there existed but two possible roads for the attainment of Truth! Believe\n      it if you can! It appears that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there\n      lived a Turkish philosopher (or Hindoo possibly) called Aries Tottle. This\n      person introduced, or at all events propagated what was termed the\n      deductive or a priori mode of investigation. He started with what he\n      maintained to be axioms or “self-evident truths,” and thence proceeded\n      “logically” to results. His greatest disciples were one Neuclid, and one\n      Cant. Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme until advent of one Hog,\n      surnamed the “Ettrick Shepherd,” who preached an entirely different\n      system, which he called the a posteriori or inductive. His plan referred\n      altogether to Sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and\n      classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly called—into\n      general laws. Aries Tottle’s mode, in a word, was based on noumena; Hog’s\n      on phenomena. Well, so great was the admiration excited by this latter\n      system that, at its first introduction, Aries Tottle fell into disrepute;\n      but finally he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of\n      Truth with his more modern rival. The savans now maintained the\n      Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to\n      knowledge. “Baconian,” you must know, was an adjective invented as\n      equivalent to Hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now, my dear friend, I do assure you, most positively, that I represent\n      this matter fairly, on the soundest authority; and you can easily\n      understand how a notion so absurd on its very face must have operated to\n      retard the progress of all true knowledge—which makes its advances\n      almost invariably by intuitive bounds. The ancient idea confined\n      investigations to crawling; and for hundreds of years so great was the\n      infatuation about Hog especially, that a virtual end was put to all\n      thinking, properly so called. No man dared utter a truth to which he felt\n      himself indebted to his Soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was\n      even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the time\n      regarded only the road by which he had attained it. They would not even\n      look at the end. “Let us see the means,” they cried, “the means!” If, upon\n      investigation of the means, it was found to come under neither the\n      category Aries (that is to say Ram) nor under the category Hog, why then\n      the savans went no farther, but pronounced the “theorist” a fool, and\n      would have nothing to do with him or his truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system the\n      greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series of ages, for\n      the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any\n      superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation. The error of\n      these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the\n      latter, by the way, were our own immediate progenitors), was an error\n      quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must\n      necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his\n      eyes. These people blinded themselves by details. When they proceeded\n      Hoggishly, their “facts” were by no means always facts—a matter of\n      little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were facts and\n      must be facts because they appeared to be such. When they proceeded on the\n      path of the Ram, their course was scarcely as straight as a ram’s horn,\n      for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all. They must have been\n      very blind not to see this, even in their own day; for even in their own\n      day many of the long “established” axioms had been rejected. For example—“Ex\n      nihilo nihil fit”; “a body cannot act where it is not”; “there cannot\n      exist antipodes”; “darkness cannot come out of light”—all these, and\n      a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted without hesitation\n      as axioms, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be\n      untenable. How absurd in these people, then, to persist in putting faith\n      in “axioms” as immutable bases of Truth! But even out of the mouths of\n      their soundest reasoners it is easy to demonstrate the futility, the\n      impalpability of their axioms in general. Who was the soundest of their\n      logicians? Let me see! I will go and ask Pundit and be back in a\n      minute.... Ah, here we have it! Here is a book written nearly a thousand\n      years ago and lately translated from the Inglitch—which, by the way,\n      appears to have been the rudiment of the Amriccan. Pundit says it is\n      decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic. The author (who\n      was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or Mill; and we find it\n      recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he had a mill-horse\n      called Bentham. But let us glance at the treatise!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Ah!—“Ability or inability to conceive,” says Mr. Mill, very\n      properly, “is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic\n      truth.” What modern in his senses would ever think of disputing this\n      truism? The only wonder with us must be, how it happened that Mr. Mill\n      conceived it necessary even to hint at any thing so obvious. So far good—but\n      let us turn over another paper. What have we here?—“Contradictories\n      cannot both be true—that is, cannot co-exist in nature.” Here Mr.\n      Mill means, for example, that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree—that\n      it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree. Very well; but I ask\n      him why. His reply is this—and never pretends to be any thing else\n      than this—“Because it is impossible to conceive that contradictories\n      can both be true.” But this is no answer at all, by his own showing, for\n      has he not just admitted as a truism that “ability or inability to\n      conceive is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is, by\n      their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether,\n      as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads\n      of Truth, of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous\n      paths—the one of creeping and the one of crawling—to which\n      they have dared to confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these\n      ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was\n      that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in\n      effect, attained? I mean the truth of Gravitation. Newton owed it to\n      Kepler. Kepler admitted that his three laws were guessed at—these\n      three laws of all laws which led the great Inglitch mathematician to his\n      principle, the basis of all physical principle—to go behind which we\n      must enter the Kingdom of Metaphysics: Kepler guessed—that is to say\n      imagined. He was essentially a “theorist”—that word now of so much\n      sanctity, formerly an epithet of contempt. Would it not have puzzled these\n      old moles too, to have explained by which of the two “roads” a\n      cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than usual secrecy, or by\n      which of the two roads Champollion directed mankind to those enduring and\n      almost innumerable truths which resulted from his deciphering the\n      Hieroglyphics.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One word more on this topic and I will be done boring you. Is it not\n      passing strange that, with their eternal prattling about roads to Truth,\n      these bigoted people missed what we now so clearly perceive to be the\n      great highway—that of Consistency? Does it not seem singular how\n      they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vital fact\n      that a perfect consistency must be an absolute truth! How plain has been\n      our progress since the late announcement of this proposition!\n      Investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles and\n      given, as a task, to the true and only true thinkers, the men of ardent\n      imagination. These latter theorize. Can you not fancy the shout of scorn\n      with which my words would be received by our progenitors were it possible\n      for them to be now looking over my shoulder? These men, I say, theorize;\n      and their theories are simply corrected, reduced, systematized—cleared,\n      little by little, of their dross of inconsistency—until, finally, a\n      perfect consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit,\n      because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and an unquestionable\n      truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      April 4.—The new gas is doing wonders, in conjunction with the new\n      improvement with gutta percha. How very safe, commodious, manageable, and\n      in every respect convenient are our modern balloons! Here is an immense\n      one approaching us at the rate of at least a hundred and fifty miles an\n      hour. It seems to be crowded with people—perhaps there are three or\n      four hundred passengers—and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a\n      mile, looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt. Still a hundred\n      or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling after all. Do you\n      remember our flight on the railroad across the Kanadaw continent?—fully\n      three hundred miles the hour—that was travelling. Nothing to be seen\n      though—nothing to be done but flirt, feast and dance in the\n      magnificent saloons. Do you remember what an odd sensation was experienced\n      when, by chance, we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars\n      were in full flight? Every thing seemed unique—in one mass. For my\n      part, I cannot say but that I preferred the travelling by the slow train\n      of a hundred miles the hour. Here we were permitted to have glass windows—even\n      to have them open—and something like a distinct view of the country\n      was attainable.... Pundit says that the route for the great Kanadaw\n      railroad must have been in some measure marked out about nine hundred\n      years ago! In fact, he goes so far as to assert that actual traces of a\n      road are still discernible—traces referable to a period quite as\n      remote as that mentioned. The track, it appears was double only; ours, you\n      know, has twelve paths; and three or four new ones are in preparation. The\n      ancient rails were very slight, and placed so close together as to be,\n      according to modern notions, quite frivolous, if not dangerous in the\n      extreme. The present width of track—fifty feet—is considered,\n      indeed, scarcely secure enough. For my part, I make no doubt that a track\n      of some sort must have existed in very remote times, as Pundit asserts;\n      for nothing can be clearer, to my mind, than that, at some period—not\n      less than seven centuries ago, certainly—the Northern and Southern\n      Kanadaw continents were united; the Kanawdians, then, would have been\n      driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      April 5.—I am almost devoured by <i>ennui</i>. Pundit is the only\n      conversible person on board; and he, poor soul! can speak of nothing but\n      antiquities. He has been occupied all the day in the attempt to convince\n      me that the ancient Amriccans governed themselves!—did ever anybody\n      hear of such an absurdity?—that they existed in a sort of\n      every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the fashion of the “prairie dogs”\n       that we read of in fable. He says that they started with the queerest idea\n      conceivable, viz: that all men are born free and equal—this in the\n      very teeth of the laws of <i>gradation</i> so visibly impressed upon all things\n      both in the moral and physical universe. Every man “voted,” as they called\n      it—that is to say meddled with public affairs—until at length,\n      it was discovered that what is everybody’s business is nobody’s, and that\n      the “Republic” (so the absurd thing was called) was without a government\n      at all. It is related, however, that the first circumstance which\n      disturbed, very particularly, the self-complacency of the philosophers who\n      constructed this “Republic,” was the startling discovery that universal\n      suffrage gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any\n      desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the\n      possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which should be\n      merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud. A little\n      reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the\n      consequences, which were that rascality must predominate—in a word,\n      that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one.\n      While the philosophers, however, were busied in blushing at their\n      stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils, and intent upon\n      the invention of new theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a\n      fellow of the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set\n      up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous Zeros and\n      Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. This Mob (a foreigner,\n      by-the-by), is said to have been the most odious of all men that ever\n      encumbered the earth. He was a giant in stature—insolent, rapacious,\n      filthy, had the gall of a bullock with the heart of a hyena and the brains\n      of a peacock. He died, at length, by dint of his own energies, which\n      exhausted him. Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however\n      vile, and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of\n      forgetting—never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies.\n      As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it upon the face of\n      the earth—unless we except the case of the “prairie dogs,” an\n      exception which seems to demonstrate, if anything, that democracy is a\n      very admirable form of government—for dogs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      April 6.—Last night had a fine view of Alpha Lyrae, whose disk,\n      through our captain’s spy-glass, subtends an angle of half a degree,\n      looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a misty day. Alpha\n      Lyrae, although so very much larger than our sun, by the by, resembles him\n      closely as regards its spots, its atmosphere, and in many other\n      particulars. It is only within the last century, Pundit tells me, that the\n      binary relation existing between these two orbs began even to be\n      suspected. The evident motion of our system in the heavens was (strange to\n      say!) referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the\n      galaxy. About this star, or at all events about a centre of gravity common\n      to all the globes of the Milky Way and supposed to be near Alcyone in the\n      Pleiades, every one of these globes was declared to be revolving, our own\n      performing the circuit in a period of 117,000,000 of years! We, with our\n      present lights, our vast telescopic improvements, and so forth, of course\n      find it difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this. Its\n      first propagator was one Mudler. He was led, we must presume, to this wild\n      hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance; but, this being the\n      case, he should have at least adhered to analogy in its development. A\n      great central orb was, in fact, suggested; so far Mudler was consistent.\n      This central orb, however, dynamically, should have been greater than all\n      its surrounding orbs taken together. The question might then have been\n      asked—“Why do we not see it?”—we, especially, who occupy the\n      mid region of the cluster—the very locality near which, at least,\n      must be situated this inconceivable central sun. The astronomer, perhaps,\n      at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non-luminosity; and here\n      analogy was suddenly let fall. But even admitting the central orb\n      non-luminous, how did he manage to explain its failure to be rendered\n      visible by the incalculable host of glorious suns glaring in all\n      directions about it? No doubt what he finally maintained was merely a\n      centre of gravity common to all the revolving orbs—but here again\n      analogy must have been let fall. Our system revolves, it is true, about a\n      common centre of gravity, but it does this in connection with and in\n      consequence of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the\n      rest of the system. The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an\n      infinity of straight lines; but this idea of the circle—this idea of\n      it which, in regard to all earthly geometry, we consider as merely the\n      mathematical, in contradistinction from the practical, idea—is, in\n      sober fact, the practical conception which alone we have any right to\n      entertain in respect to those Titanic circles with which we have to deal,\n      at least in fancy, when we suppose our system, with its fellows, revolving\n      about a point in the centre of the galaxy. Let the most vigorous of human\n      imaginations but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of\n      a circuit so unutterable! It would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a\n      flash of lightning itself, travelling forever upon the circumference of\n      this inconceivable circle, would still forever be travelling in a straight\n      line. That the path of our sun along such a circumference—that the\n      direction of our system in such an orbit—would, to any human\n      perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line even in a\n      million of years, is a proposition not to be entertained; and yet these\n      ancient astronomers were absolutely cajoled, it appears, into believing\n      that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief period of\n      their astronomical history—during the mere point—during the\n      utter nothingness of two or three thousand years! How incomprehensible,\n      that considerations such as this did not at once indicate to them the true\n      state of affairs—that of the binary revolution of our sun and Alpha\n      Lyrae around a common centre of gravity!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      April 7.—Continued last night our astronomical amusements. Had a\n      fine view of the five Neptunian asteroids, and watched with much interest\n      the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels in the new temple\n      at Daphnis in the moon. It was amusing to think that creatures so\n      diminutive as the lunarians, and bearing so little resemblance to\n      humanity, yet evinced a mechanical ingenuity so much superior to our own.\n      One finds it difficult, too, to conceive the vast masses which these\n      people handle so easily, to be as light as our own reason tells us they\n      actually are.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      April 8.—Eureka! Pundit is in his glory. A balloon from Kanadaw\n      spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers; they contain some\n      exceedingly curious information relative to Kanawdian or rather Amriccan\n      antiquities. You know, I presume, that laborers have for some months been\n      employed in preparing the ground for a new fountain at Paradise, the\n      Emperor’s principal pleasure garden. Paradise, it appears, has been,\n      literally speaking, an island time out of mind—that is to say, its\n      northern boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a\n      rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea. This arm was gradually\n      widened until it attained its present breadth—a mile. The whole\n      length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies materially. The\n      entire area (so Pundit says) was, about eight hundred years ago, densely\n      packed with houses, some of them twenty stories high; land (for some most\n      unaccountable reason) being considered as especially precious just in this\n      vicinity. The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally\n      uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to be\n      called a village) that the most indefatigable of our antiquarians have\n      never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data (in the\n      shape of coins, medals or inscriptions) wherewith to build up even the\n      ghost of a theory concerning the manners, customs, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,\n      of the aboriginal inhabitants. Nearly all that we have hitherto known of\n      them is, that they were a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages\n      infesting the continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker, a knight\n      of the Golden Fleece. They were by no means uncivilized, however, but\n      cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of their own. It\n      is related of them that they were acute in many respects, but were oddly\n      afflicted with monomania for building what, in the ancient Amriccan, was\n      denominated “churches”—a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship\n      of two idols that went by the names of Wealth and Fashion. In the end, it\n      is said, the island became, nine tenths of it, church. The women, too, it\n      appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the region just\n      below the small of the back—although, most unaccountably, this\n      deformity was looked upon altogether in the light of a beauty. One or two\n      pictures of these singular women have in fact, been miraculously\n      preserved. They look very odd, very—like something between a\n      turkey-cock and a dromedary.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Well, these few details are nearly all that have descended to us\n      respecting the ancient Knickerbockers. It seems, however, that while\n      digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you know, covers the\n      whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a cubical and evidently\n      chiseled block of granite, weighing several hundred pounds. It was in good\n      preservation, having received, apparently, little injury from the\n      convulsion which entombed it. On one of its surfaces was a marble slab\n      with (only think of it!) an inscription—a legible inscription.\n      Pundit is in ecstacies. Upon detaching the slab, a cavity appeared,\n      containing a leaden box filled with various coins, a long scroll of names,\n      several documents which appear to resemble newspapers, with other matters\n      of intense interest to the antiquarian! There can be no doubt that all\n      these are genuine Amriccan relics belonging to the tribe called\n      Knickerbocker. The papers thrown on board our balloon are filled with\n      fac-similes of the coins, MSS., typography, &amp;c., &amp;c. I copy for\n      your amusement the Knickerbocker inscription on the marble slab:—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n          This Corner Stone of a Monument to<br>\n                  The Memory of<br>\n                GEORGE WASHINGTON<br>\n          Was Laid With Appropriate Ceremonies<br>\n                    on the<br>\n             19th Day of October, 1847<br>\n          The anniversary of the surrender of<br>\n                 Lord Cornwallis<br>\n          to General Washington at Yorktown<br>\n                 A. D. 1781<br>\n            Under the Auspices of the<br>\n          Washington Monument Association of<br>\n                the city of New York\n</p>\n<p>\n      This, as I give it, is a verbatim translation done by Pundit himself, so\n      there can be no mistake about it. From the few words thus preserved, we\n      glean several important items of knowledge, not the least interesting of\n      which is the fact that a thousand years ago actual monuments had fallen\n      into disuse—as was all very proper—the people contenting\n      themselves, as we do now, with a mere indication of the design to erect a\n      monument at some future time; a corner-stone being cautiously laid by\n      itself “solitary and alone” (excuse me for quoting the great American poet\n      Benton!), as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention. We ascertain, too,\n      very distinctly, from this admirable inscription, the how as well as the\n      where and the what, of the great surrender in question. As to the where,\n      it was Yorktown (wherever that was), and as to the what, it was General\n      Cornwallis (no doubt some wealthy dealer in corn). He was surrendered. The\n      inscription commemorates the surrender of—what?—why, “of Lord\n      Cornwallis.” The only question is what could the savages wish him\n      surrendered for. But when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly\n      cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended him for\n      sausage. As to the how of the surrender, no language can be more explicit.\n      Lord Cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage) “under the auspices of the\n      Washington Monument Association”—no doubt a charitable institution\n      for the depositing of corner-stones.—But, Heaven bless me! what is\n      the matter? Ah, I see—the balloon has collapsed, and we shall have a\n      tumble into the sea. I have, therefore, only time enough to add that, from\n      a hasty inspection of the fac-similes of newspapers, &amp;c., &amp;c., I\n      find that the great men in those days among the Amriccans, were one John,\n      a smith, and one Zacchary, a tailor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Good-bye, until I see you again. Whether you ever get this letter or not\n      is point of little importance, as I write altogether for my own amusement.\n      I shall cork the MS. up in a bottle, however, and throw it into the sea.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      Yours everlastingly,<br>\n       P<small>UNDITA</small>.\n</p>\n",

Who was it died of “The Andromache”? {*1}\n      Ignoble souls!—De L’Omelette perished of an ortolan. <i>L’histoire en\n      est brève</i>. Assist me, Spirit of Apicius!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored, melting,\n      indolent, to the <i>Chaussée D’Antin</i>, from its home in far Peru. From its\n      queenly possessor La Bellissima, to the Duc De L’Omelette, six peers of\n      the empire conveyed the happy bird.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That night the Duc was to sup alone. In the privacy of his bureau he\n      reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his loyalty in\n      outbidding his king—the notorious ottoman of Cadêt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes! Unable to restrain\n      his feelings, his Grace swallows an olive. At this moment the door gently\n      opens to the sound of soft music, and lo! the most delicate of birds is\n      before the most enamored of men! But what inexpressible dismay now\n      overshadows the countenance of the Duc?—“<i>Horreur!—chien!\n      Baptiste!—l’oiseau! ah, bon Dieu! cet oiseau modeste que tu as\n      déshabillé de ses plumes, et que tu as servi sans papier!</i>” It is\n      superfluous to say more:—the Duc expired in a paroxysm of disgust.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!” said his Grace on the third day after his decease.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He! he! he!” replied the Devil faintly, drawing himself up with an air of\n      <i>hauteur</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, surely you are not serious,” retorted De L’Omelette. “I have sinned—c’est\n      vrai—but, my good sir, consider!—you have no actual intention\n      of putting such—such barbarous threats into execution.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No <i>what?</i>” said his majesty—“come, sir, strip!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Strip, indeed! very pretty i’ faith! no, sir, I shall <i>not</i> strip. Who are\n      you, pray, that I, Duc De L’Omelette, Prince de Foie-Gras, just come of\n      age, author of the ‘Mazurkiad,’ and Member of the Academy, should divest\n      myself at your bidding of the sweetest pantaloons ever made by Bourdon,\n      the daintiest <i>robe-de-chambre</i> ever put together by Rombêrt—to say\n      nothing of the taking my hair out of paper—not to mention the\n      trouble I should have in drawing off my gloves?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Who am I?—ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of the Fly. I took\n      thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory. Thou wast\n      curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. Belial sent thee,—my\n      Inspector of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou sayest were made by\n      Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen drawers, and thy <i>robe-de-chambre</i>\n      is a shroud of no scanty dimensions.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sir!” replied the Duc, “I am not to be insulted with impunity!—Sir!\n      I shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging this insult!—Sir!\n      you shall hear from me! in the meantime <i>au revoir!</i>”—and the Duc was\n      bowing himself out of the Satanic presence, when he was interrupted and\n      brought back by a gentleman in waiting. Hereupon his Grace rubbed his\n      eyes, yawned, shrugged his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied\n      of his identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The apartment was superb. Even De L’Omelette pronounced it <i>bien comme il\n      faut</i>. It was not its length nor its breadth,—but its height—ah,\n      that was appalling!—There was no ceiling—certainly none—but\n      a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. His Grace’s brain reeled as\n      he glanced upward. From above, hung a chain of an unknown blood-red metal—its\n      upper end lost, like the city of Boston, <i>parmi les nues</i>. From its nether\n      extremity swung a large cresset. The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it\n      there poured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never\n      worshipped such—Gheber never imagined such—Mussulman never\n      dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of\n      poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the God Apollo. The Duc\n      muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The corners of the room were rounded into niches. Three of these were\n      filled with statues of gigantic proportions. Their beauty was Grecian,\n      their deformity Egyptian, their <i>tout ensemble</i> French. In the fourth niche\n      the statue was veiled; it was <i>not</i> colossal. But then there was a taper\n      ankle, a sandalled foot. De L’Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart,\n      closed his eyes, raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty—in a\n      blush.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the paintings!—Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!—a thousand and\n      the same! And Rafaelle has beheld them! Yes, Rafaelle has been here, for\n      did he not paint the—? and was he not consequently damned? The\n      paintings—the paintings! O luxury! O love!—who, gazing on\n      those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices of the\n      golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth and the porphyry\n      walls?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the Duc’s heart is fainting within him. He is not, however, as you\n      suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the ecstatic breath of\n      those innumerable censers. <i>C’est vrai que de toutes ces choses il a pensé\n      beaucoup—mais!</i> The Duc De L’Omelette is terror-stricken; for,\n      through the lurid vista which a single uncurtained window is affording,\n      lo! gleams the most ghastly of all fires!\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Le pauvre Duc!</i> He could not help imagining that the glorious, the\n      voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that hall, as they\n      passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy of the enchanted\n      window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the hopeless and the\n      damned! And there, too!—there!—upon the ottoman!—who\n      could <i>he</i> be?—he, the <i>petitmaître</i>—no, the Deity—who sat\n      as if carved in marble, <i>et qui sourit</i>, with his pale countenance, <i>si\n      amèrement?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Mais il faut agir</i>—that is to say, a Frenchman never faints\n      outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene—De L’Omelette is\n      himself again. There were some foils upon a table—some points also.\n      The Duc had studied under B——; <i>il avait tué ses six\n      hommes.</i> Now, then, <i>il peut s’échapper</i>. He measures two\n      points, and, with a grace inimitable, offers his Majesty the choice.\n      <i>Horreur!</i> his Majesty does not fence!\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Mais il joue!</i>—how happy a thought!—but his Grace had always an\n      excellent memory. He had dipped in the “<i>Diable</i>” of Abbé Gualtier. Therein\n      it is said “<i>que le Diable n’ose pas refuser un jeu d’écarté.</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      But the chances—the chances! True—desperate: but scarcely\n      more desperate than the Duc. Besides, was he not in the secret?—had\n      he not skimmed over Père Le Brun?—was he not a member of the Club\n      Vingt-un? “<i>Si je perds</i>,” said he, “<i>je serai\n      deux fois perdu</i>—I shall be doubly damned—<i>voilà\n      tout!</i> (Here his Grace shrugged his shoulders.) <i>Si je gagne, je\n      reviendrai a mes ortolans—que les cartes soient\n      préparées!</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      His Grace was all care, all attention—his Majesty all confidence. A\n      spectator would have thought of Francis and Charles. His Grace thought of\n      his game. His Majesty did not think; he shuffled. The Duc cut.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The cards were dealt. The trump is turned—it is—it is—the\n      king! No—it was the queen. His Majesty cursed her masculine\n      habiliments. De L’Omelette placed his hand upon his heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His Majesty counts heavily,\n      smiles, and is taking wine. The Duc slips a card.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>C’est à vous à faire</i>,” said his Majesty, cutting. His Grace bowed, dealt,\n      and arose from the table <i>en presentant le Roi</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His Majesty looked chagrined.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have been Diogenes; and the Duc\n      assured his antagonist in taking leave, “<i>que s’il n’eût été De L’Omelette\n      il n’aurait point d’objection d’être le Diable.</i>”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.14\"></a>THE OBLONG BOX.</h2>\n<p>\n      Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C., to the city of\n      New York, in the fine packet-ship “Independence,” Captain Hardy. We were\n      to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June), weather permitting; and on\n      the fourteenth, I went on board to arrange some matters in my state-room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more\n      than usual number of ladies. On the list were several of my acquaintances,\n      and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt,\n      a young artist, for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship. He had\n      been with me a fellow-student at C—— University, where we were very\n      much together. He had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a\n      compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. To these qualities\n      he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and, upon\n      again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he had engaged\n      passage for himself, wife, and two sisters—his own. The state-rooms\n      were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other.\n      These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient\n      for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were\n      three state-rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in\n      one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive\n      about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a\n      variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the\n      supernumerary state-room. It was no business of mine, to be sure, but with\n      none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the\n      enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder\n      why I had not arrived at it before. “It is a servant of course,” I said;\n      “what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!”\n       And then I again repaired to the list—but here I saw distinctly that\n      no servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the\n      original design to bring one—for the words “and servant” had been\n      first written and then overscored. “Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,” I now\n      said to myself—“something he wishes not to be put in the hold—something\n      to be kept under his own eye—ah, I have it—a painting or so—and\n      this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew.”\n       This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Wyatt’s two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls\n      they were. His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her. He\n      had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style\n      of enthusiasm. He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and\n      accomplishment. I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt and party\n      were also to visit it—so the captain informed me—and I waited\n      on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of being presented to\n      the bride, but then an apology came. “Mrs. W. was a little indisposed, and\n      would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the wharf, when\n      Captain Hardy met me and said that, “owing to circumstances” (a stupid but\n      convenient phrase), “he rather thought the ‘Independence’ would not sail\n      for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me\n      know.” This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but\n      as “the circumstances” were not forthcoming, although I pumped for them\n      with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return home and digest\n      my impatience at leisure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week.\n      It came at length, however, and I immediately went on board. The ship was\n      crowded with passengers, and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon\n      making sail. Wyatt’s party arrived in about ten minutes after myself.\n      There were the two sisters, the bride, and the artist—the latter in\n      one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to\n      these, however, to pay them any special attention. He did not even\n      introduce me to his wife—this courtesy devolving, per force, upon\n      his sister Marian—a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few\n      hurried words, made us acquainted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in\n      acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly astonished. I\n      should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me\n      not to trust, with too implicit a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions\n      of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness\n      of woman. When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he\n      soared into the regions of the purely ideal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a decidedly\n      plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was not, I think, very\n      far from it. She was dressed, however, in exquisite taste—and then I\n      had no doubt that she had captivated my friend’s heart by the more\n      enduring graces of the intellect and soul. She said very few words, and\n      passed at once into her state-room with Mr. W.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was no servant—that was a\n      settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage. After some\n      delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was\n      every thing that seemed to be expected. Immediately upon its arrival we\n      made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out\n      to sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet in length\n      by two and a half in breadth; I observed it attentively, and like to be\n      precise. Now this shape was peculiar; and no sooner had I seen it, than I\n      took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the\n      conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend,\n      the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew\n      he had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:—and now\n      here was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain nothing in\n      the world but a copy of Leonardo’s “Last Supper;” and a copy of this very\n      “Last Supper,” done by Rubini the younger, at Florence, I had known, for\n      some time, to be in the possession of Nicolino. This point, therefore, I\n      considered as sufficiently settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought\n      of my acumen. It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me\n      any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a\n      march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my very nose;\n      expecting me to know nothing of the matter. I resolved to quiz him well,\n      now and hereafter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did not go into the\n      extra state-room. It was deposited in Wyatt’s own; and there, too, it\n      remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor—no doubt to\n      the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife;—this the more\n      especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling\n      capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly\n      disgusting odor. On the lid were painted the words—“Mrs. Adelaide\n      Curtis, Albany, New York. Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. This side up. To\n      be handled with care.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the artist’s\n      wife’s mother,—but then I looked upon the whole address as a\n      mystification, intended especially for myself. I made up my mind, of\n      course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the\n      studio of my misanthropic friend, in Chambers Street, New York.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind\n      was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon\n      our losing sight of the coast. The passengers were, consequently, in high\n      spirits and disposed to be social. I must except, however, Wyatt and his\n      sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking,\n      uncourteously to the rest of the party. Wyatt’s conduct I did not so much\n      regard. He was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit—in fact he was\n      morose—but in him I was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters,\n      however, I could make no excuse. They secluded themselves in their\n      staterooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused,\n      although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on\n      board.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable. That is to say, she was chatty;\n      and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea. She became\n      excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound\n      astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men. She\n      amused us all very much. I say “amused”—and scarcely know how to\n      explain myself. The truth is, I soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener\n      laughed at than with. The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies,\n      in a little while, pronounced her “a good-hearted thing, rather\n      indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.” The great\n      wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match. Wealth was the\n      general solution—but this I knew to be no solution at all; for Wyatt\n      had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations\n      from any source whatever. “He had married,” he said, “for love, and for\n      love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love.” When I\n      thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I\n      felt indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking leave\n      of his senses? What else could I think? He, so refined, so intellectual,\n      so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen\n      an appreciation of the beautiful! To be sure, the lady seemed especially\n      fond of him—particularly so in his absence—when she made\n      herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her\n      “beloved husband, Mr. Wyatt.” The word “husband” seemed forever—to\n      use one of her own delicate expressions—forever “on the tip of her\n      tongue.” In the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided\n      her in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up\n      alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live\n      altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she\n      thought best, in the public society of the main cabin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist, by some\n      unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and\n      fanciful passion, had been induced to unite himself with a person\n      altogether beneath him, and that the natural result, entire and speedy\n      disgust, had ensued. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart—but\n      could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the\n      matter of the “Last Supper.” For this I resolved to have my revenge.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, I\n      sauntered with him backward and forward. His gloom, however (which I\n      considered quite natural under the circumstances), seemed entirely\n      unabated. He said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort. I\n      ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor\n      fellow!—as I thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have\n      heart to put on even the semblance of mirth. I determined to commence a\n      series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box—just\n      to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the butt, or\n      victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My first observation\n      was by way of opening a masked battery. I said something about the\n      “peculiar shape of <i>that</i> box”; and, as I spoke the words, I smiled\n      knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced me,\n      at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at me as if he found it\n      impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point\n      seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes, in the same\n      proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets. Then he grew very red—then\n      hideously pale—then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated,\n      he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept\n      up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In\n      conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to uplift\n      him, to all appearance he was dead.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself.\n      Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. At length we bled him\n      and put him to bed. The next morning he was quite recovered, so far as\n      regarded his mere bodily health. Of his mind I say nothing, of course. I\n      avoided him during the rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who\n      seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but\n      cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of Wyatt which\n      contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed.\n      Among other things, this: I had been nervous—drank too much strong\n      green tea, and slept ill at night—in fact, for two nights I could\n      not be properly said to sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the\n      main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board.\n      Wyatt’s three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the\n      main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As we were\n      almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the\n      ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side\n      was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so\n      remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth\n      was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well\n      as the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on\n      account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly,\n      and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms\n      of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights (not consecutive) while I lay awake,\n      I clearly saw Mrs. W., about eleven o’clock upon each night, steal\n      cautiously from the state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where\n      she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went\n      back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had separate\n      apartments—no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce;\n      and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the extra state-room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much. During the\n      two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of\n      Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was attracted by certain singular\n      cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband. After listening to them\n      for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly\n      in translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the artist in\n      prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet—the\n      latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or\n      cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he\n      fairly disengaged the lid—also, that I could determine when he\n      removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in\n      his room; this latter point I knew, for example, by certain slight taps\n      which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as\n      he endeavored to lay it down very gently—there being no room for it\n      on the floor. After this there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing\n      more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may\n      mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to\n      be nearly inaudible—if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were\n      not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it seemed to resemble\n      sobbing or sighing—but, of course, it could not have been either. I\n      rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. Mr. Wyatt, no doubt,\n      according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies—indulging\n      in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box,\n      in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was\n      nothing in this, however, to make him sob. I repeat, therefore, that it\n      must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain\n      Hardy’s green tea. Just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which I\n      speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box,\n      and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet.\n      Having done this, he issued from his state-room, fully dressed, and\n      proceeded to call Mrs. W. from hers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras, when there\n      came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. We were, in a measure,\n      prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for\n      some time. Every thing was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind\n      steadily freshened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail,\n      both double-reefed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours—the ship\n      proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and shipping no\n      water of any consequence. At the end of this period, however, the gale\n      had freshened into a hurricane, and our after-sail split into ribbons,\n      bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several\n      prodigious seas, one immediately after the other. By this accident we\n      lost three men overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the\n      larboard bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the\n      foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay-sail and with\n      this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more\n      steadily than before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating. The\n      rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third\n      day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy\n      lurch to windward, went by the board. For an hour or more, we tried in\n      vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship;\n      and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four\n      feet of water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps\n      choked and nearly useless.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All was now confusion and despair—but an effort was made to lighten\n      the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached,\n      and by cutting away the two masts that remained. This we at last\n      accomplished—but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps;\n      and, in the meantime, the leak gained on us very fast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea\n      went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in\n      the boats. At eight P. M., the clouds broke away to windward, and we had\n      the advantage of a full moon—a piece of good fortune which served\n      wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the longboat\n      over the side without material accident, and into this we crowded the\n      whole of the crew and most of the passengers. This party made off\n      immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering, finally arrived, in\n      safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day after the wreck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board, resolving to\n      trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern. We lowered it without\n      difficulty, although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from\n      swamping as it touched the water. It contained, when afloat, the captain\n      and his wife, Mr. Wyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children,\n      and myself, with a negro valet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively necessary\n      instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our backs. No one had\n      thought of even attempting to save any thing more. What must have been the\n      astonishment of all, then, when having proceeded a few fathoms from the\n      ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of\n      Captain Hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking\n      in his oblong box!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,” replied the captain, somewhat sternly, “you will\n      capsize us if you do not sit quite still. Our gunwhale is almost in the\n      water now.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The box!” vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing—“the box, I say!\n      Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. Its weight will be but\n      a trifle—it is nothing—mere nothing. By the mother who bore\n      you—for the love of Heaven—by your hope of salvation, I\n      implore you to put back for the box!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal of the\n      artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mr. Wyatt, you are mad. I cannot listen to you. Sit down, I say, or you\n      will swamp the boat. Stay—hold him—seize him!—he is\n      about to spring overboard! There—I knew it—he is over!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the boat, and,\n      as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by almost superhuman\n      exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore-chains. In\n      another moment he was on board, and rushing frantically down into the\n      cabin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being quite out\n      of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still\n      running. We made a determined effort to put back, but our little boat was\n      like a feather in the breath of the tempest. We saw at a glance that the\n      doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for as such\n      only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the companion—way,\n      up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic, he dragged, bodily,\n      the oblong box. While we gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he\n      passed, rapidly, several turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box\n      and then around his body. In another instant both body and box were in the\n      sea—disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted upon the\n      spot. At length we pulled away. The silence remained unbroken for an hour.\n      Finally, I hazarded a remark.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank? Was not that an\n      exceedingly singular thing? I confess that I entertained some feeble hope\n      of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself to the box, and\n      commit himself to the sea.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “They sank as a matter of course,” replied the captain, “and that like a\n      shot. They will soon rise again, however—but not till the salt\n      melts.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The salt!” I ejaculated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hush!” said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the\n      deceased. “We must talk of these things at some more appropriate time.”\n     </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      We suffered much, and made a narrow escape; but fortune befriended us, as\n      well as our mates in the long-boat. We landed, in fine, more dead than\n      alive, after four days of intense distress, upon the beach opposite\n      Roanoke Island. We remained here a week, were not ill-treated by the\n      wreckers, and at length obtained a passage to New York.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About a month after the loss of the “Independence,” I happened to meet\n      Captain Hardy in Broadway. Our conversation turned, naturally, upon the\n      disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor Wyatt. I thus learned\n      the following particulars.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and a\n      servant. His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely,\n      and most accomplished woman. On the morning of the fourteenth of June (the\n      day in which I first visited the ship), the lady suddenly sickened and\n      died. The young husband was frantic with grief—but circumstances\n      imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to New York. It was\n      necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the\n      other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so\n      openly was well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned\n      the ship rather than take passage with a dead body.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being first\n      partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of salt, in a box of\n      suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise. Nothing\n      was to be said of the lady’s decease; and, as it was well understood that\n      Mr. Wyatt had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some\n      person should personate her during the voyage. This the deceased\n      lady’s-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra state-room,\n      originally engaged for this girl during her mistress’ life, was now merely\n      retained. In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept, of course, every\n      night. In the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part\n      of her mistress—whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was\n      unknown to any of the passengers on board.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too\n      inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. But of late, it is a rare\n      thing that I sleep soundly at night. There is a countenance which haunts\n      me, turn as I will. There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring\n      within my ears.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.15\"></a>LOSS OF BREATH</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\nO breathe not, etc.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Moore’s <i>Melodies</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      The most notorious ill-fortune must in the end yield to the untiring\n      courage of philosophy—as the most stubborn city to the ceaseless\n      vigilance of an enemy. Shalmanezer, as we have it in holy writings, lay\n      three years before Samaria; yet it fell. Sardanapalus—see\n      Diodorus—maintained himself seven in Nineveh; but to no purpose.\n      Troy expired at the close of the second lustrum; and Azoth, as Aristaeus\n      declares upon his honour as a gentleman, opened at last her gates to\n      Psammetichus, after having barred them for the fifth part of a\n      century....\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Thou wretch!—thou vixen!—thou shrew!” said I to\n      my wife on the morning after our wedding; “thou witch!—thou\n      hag!—thou whippersnapper—thou sink of iniquity!—thou\n      fiery-faced quintessence of all that is\n      abominable!—thou—thou—” here standing upon\n      tiptoe, seizing her by the throat, and placing my mouth close to her ear,\n      I was preparing to launch forth a new and more decided epithet of\n      opprobrium, which should not fail, if ejaculated, to convince her of her\n      insignificance, when to my extreme horror and astonishment I discovered\n      that I had lost my breath.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The phrases “I am out of breath,” “I have lost my breath,” etc., are often\n      enough repeated in common conversation; but it had never occurred to me\n      that the terrible accident of which I speak could <i>bona fide</i> and actually\n      happen! Imagine—that is if you have a fanciful turn—imagine, I\n      say, my wonder—my consternation—my despair!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is a good genius, however, which has never entirely deserted me. In\n      my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense of propriety, <i>et le\n      chemin des passions me conduit</i>—as Lord Edouard in the “Julie” says\n      it did him—<i>à la philosophie véritable</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree the\n      occurrence had affected me, I determined at all events to conceal the\n      matter from my wife, until further experience should discover to me the\n      extent of this my unheard of calamity. Altering my countenance, therefore,\n      in a moment, from its bepuffed and distorted appearance, to an expression\n      of arch and coquettish benignity, I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek,\n      and a kiss on the other, and without saying one syllable (Furies! I could\n      not), left her astonished at my drollery, as I pirouetted out of the room\n      in a <i>pas de zephyr</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fearful instance\n      of the ill consequences attending upon irascibility—alive, with the\n      qualifications of the dead—dead, with the propensities of the living—an\n      anomaly on the face of the earth—being very calm, yet breathless.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yes! breathless. I am serious in asserting that my breath was entirely\n      gone. I could not have stirred with it a feather if my life had been at\n      issue, or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror. Hard fate!—yet\n      there was some alleviation to the first overwhelming paroxysm of my\n      sorrow. I found, upon trial, that the powers of utterance which, upon my\n      inability to proceed in the conversation with my wife, I then concluded to\n      be totally destroyed, were in fact only partially impeded, and I\n      discovered that had I, at that interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a\n      singularly deep guttural, I might still have continued to her the\n      communication of my sentiments; this pitch of voice (the guttural)\n      depending, I find, not upon the current of the breath, but upon a certain\n      spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Throwing myself upon a chair, I remained for some time absorbed in\n      meditation. My reflections, be sure, were of no consolatory kind. A\n      thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession of my soul—and\n      even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain; but it is a trait in the\n      perversity of human nature to reject the obvious and the ready, for the\n      far-distant and equivocal. Thus I shuddered at self-murder as the most\n      decided of atrocities while the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug,\n      and the very water-dog wheezed assiduously under the table, each taking to\n      itself much merit for the strength of its lungs, and all obviously done in\n      derision of my own pulmonary incapacity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, I at length heard the\n      footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. Being now assured of her\n      absence, I returned with a palpitating heart to the scene of my disaster.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Carefully locking the door on the inside, I commenced a vigorous search.\n      It was possible, I thought, that, concealed in some obscure corner, or\n      lurking in some closet or drawer, might be found the lost object of my\n      inquiry. It might have a vapory—it might even have a tangible form.\n      Most philosophers, upon many points of philosophy, are still very\n      unphilosophical. William Godwin, however, says in his “Mandeville,” that\n      “invisible things are the only realities,” and this, all will allow, is a\n      case in point. I would have the judicious reader pause before accusing\n      such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. Anaxagoras, it will\n      be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this I have since found\n      to be the case.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the contemptible\n      reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be only a set of false\n      teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle of billets-doux from Mr.\n      Windenough to my wife. I might as well here observe that this confirmation\n      of my lady’s partiality for Mr. W. occasioned me little uneasiness. That\n      Mrs. Lackobreath should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a\n      natural and necessary evil. I am, it is well known, of a robust and\n      corpulent appearance, and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature.\n      What wonder, then, that the lath-like tenuity of my acquaintance, and his\n      altitude, which has grown into a proverb, should have met with all due\n      estimation in the eyes of Mrs. Lackobreath. But to return.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My exertions, as I have before said, proved fruitless. Closet after closet—drawer\n      after drawer—corner after corner—were scrutinized to no\n      purpose. At one time, however, I thought myself sure of my prize, having,\n      in rummaging a dressing-case, accidentally demolished a bottle of\n      Grandjean’s Oil of Archangels—which, as an agreeable perfume, I here\n      take the liberty of recommending.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir—there to ponder upon\n      some method of eluding my wife’s penetration, until I could make\n      arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this I had already\n      made up my mind. In a foreign climate, being unknown, I might, with some\n      probability of success, endeavor to conceal my unhappy calamity—a\n      calamity calculated, even more than beggary, to estrange the affections of\n      the multitude, and to draw down upon the wretch the well-merited\n      indignation of the virtuous and the happy. I was not long in hesitation.\n      Being naturally quick, I committed to memory the entire tragedy of\n      “Metamora.” I had the good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation\n      of this drama, or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the\n      hero, the tones of voice in which I found myself deficient were altogether\n      unnecessary, and the deep guttural was expected to reign monotonously\n      throughout.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented marsh;—herein,\n      however, having no reference to a similar proceeding of Demosthenes, but\n      from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my own. Thus armed at all\n      points, I determined to make my wife believe that I was suddenly smitten\n      with a passion for the stage. In this, I succeeded to a miracle; and to\n      every question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my most\n      frog-like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the tragedy—any\n      portion of which, as I soon took great pleasure in observing, would apply\n      equally well to any particular subject. It is not to be supposed, however,\n      that in the delivery of such passages I was found at all deficient in the\n      looking asquint—the showing my teeth—the working my knees—the\n      shuffling my feet—or in any of those unmentionable graces which are\n      now justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer. To be\n      sure they spoke of confining me in a strait-jacket—but, good God!\n      they never suspected me of having lost my breath.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having at length put my affairs in order, I took my seat very early one\n      morning in the mail stage for ——, giving it to be understood, among my\n      acquaintances, that business of the last importance required my immediate\n      personal attendance in that city.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain twilight the\n      features of my companions could not be distinguished. Without making any\n      effectual resistance, I suffered myself to be placed between two gentlemen\n      of colossal dimensions; while a third, of a size larger, requesting pardon\n      for the liberty he was about to take, threw himself upon my body at full\n      length, and falling asleep in an instant, drowned all my guttural\n      ejaculations for relief, in a snore which would have put to blush the\n      roarings of the bull of Phalaris. Happily the state of my respiratory\n      faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the question.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the\n      outskirts of the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his\n      shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility. Seeing\n      that I remained motionless (all my limbs were dislocated and my head\n      twisted on one side), his apprehensions began to be excited; and arousing\n      the rest of the passengers, he communicated, in a very decided manner, his\n      opinion that a dead man had been palmed upon them during the night for a\n      living and responsible fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the\n      right eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon all, one after another (there were nine in company), believed it\n      their duty to pull me by the ear. A young practising physician, too,\n      having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and found me without breath,\n      the assertion of my persecutor was pronounced a true bill; and the whole\n      party expressed a determination to endure tamely no such impositions for\n      the future, and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the\n      present.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was here, accordingly, thrown out at the sign of the “Crow” (by which\n      tavern the coach happened to be passing), without meeting with any farther\n      accident than the breaking of both my arms, under the left hind wheel of\n      the vehicle. I must besides do the driver the justice to state that he did\n      not forget to throw after me the largest of my trunks, which,\n      unfortunately falling on my head, fractured my skull in a manner at once\n      interesting and extraordinary.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The landlord of the “Crow,” who is a hospitable man, finding that my trunk\n      contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little trouble he might take\n      in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon of his acquaintance, and\n      delivered me to his care with a bill and receipt for ten dollars.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations\n      immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs of\n      animation. He now rang the bell, and sent for a neighboring apothecary\n      with whom to consult in the emergency. In case of his suspicions with\n      regard to my existence proving ultimately correct, he, in the meantime,\n      made an incision in my stomach, and removed several of my viscera for\n      private dissection.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead. This idea I\n      endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my might, and making\n      the most furious contortions—for the operations of the surgeon had,\n      in a measure, restored me to the possession of my faculties. All, however,\n      was attributed to the effects of a new galvanic battery, wherewith the\n      apothecary, who is really a man of information, performed several curious\n      experiments, in which, from my personal share in their fulfillment, I\n      could not help feeling deeply interested. It was a course of mortification\n      to me, nevertheless, that although I made several attempts at\n      conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance, that I\n      could not even open my mouth; much less, then, make reply to some\n      ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under other circumstances, my\n      minute acquaintance with the Hippocratian pathology would have afforded me\n      a ready confutation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners remanded me\n      for farther examination. I was taken up into a garret; and the surgeon’s\n      lady having accommodated me with drawers and stockings, the surgeon\n      himself fastened my hands, and tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief—then\n      bolted the door on the outside as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me\n      alone to silence and to meditation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have spoken had not my\n      mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief. Consoling myself with\n      this reflection, I was mentally repeating some passages of the\n      “Omnipresence of the Deity,” as is my custom before resigning myself to\n      sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and vituperative turn, entering at a\n      hole in the wall, leaped up with a flourish a la Catalani, and alighting\n      opposite one another on my visage, betook themselves to indecorous\n      contention for the paltry consideration of my nose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the throne\n      of Cyrus, the Magian or Mige-Gush of Persia, and as the cutting off his\n      nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon, so the loss of a few ounces of my\n      countenance proved the salvation of my body. Aroused by the pain, and\n      burning with indignation, I burst, at a single effort, the fastenings and\n      the bandage. Stalking across the room I cast a glance of contempt at the\n      belligerents, and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and\n      disappointment, precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the window.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The mail-robber W——, to whom I bore a singular resemblance,\n      was at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected for\n      his execution in the suburbs. His extreme infirmity and long continued\n      ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining unmanacled; and\n      habited in his gallows costume—one very similar to my own,—he\n      lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman’s cart (which\n      happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my\n      precipitation) without any other guard than the driver, who was asleep,\n      and two recruits of the sixth infantry, who were drunk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As ill-luck would have it, I alit upon my feet within the vehicle.\n      W——, who was an acute fellow, perceived his opportunity.\n      Leaping up immediately, he bolted out behind, and turning down an alley,\n      was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye. The recruits, aroused by the\n      bustle, could not exactly comprehend the merits of the transaction.\n      Seeing, however, a man, the precise counterpart of the felon, standing\n      upright in the cart before their eyes, they were of the opinion that the\n      rascal (meaning W——) was after making his escape, (so they\n      expressed themselves), and, having communicated this opinion to one\n      another, they took each a dram, and then knocked me down with the\n      butt-ends of their muskets.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. Of course\n      nothing could be said in my defence. Hanging was my inevitable fate. I\n      resigned myself thereto with a feeling half stupid, half acrimonious.\n      Being little of a cynic, I had all the sentiments of a dog. The hangman,\n      however, adjusted the noose about my neck. The drop fell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although here,\n      undoubtedly, I could speak to the point, and it is a topic upon which\n      nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon such a theme it is\n      necessary to have been hanged. Every author should confine himself to\n      matters of experience. Thus Mark Antony composed a treatise upon getting\n      drunk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I may just mention, however, that die I did not. My body was, but I had no\n      breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my left ear (which had\n      the feel of a military stock) I dare say that I should have experienced\n      very little inconvenience. As for the jerk given to my neck upon the\n      falling of the drop, it merely proved a corrective to the twist afforded\n      me by the fat gentleman in the coach.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd the worth of\n      their trouble. My convulsions were said to be extraordinary. My spasms it\n      would have been difficult to beat. The populace encored. Several gentlemen\n      swooned; and a multitude of ladies were carried home in hysterics. Pinxit\n      availed himself of the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon\n      the spot, his admirable painting of the “Marsyas flayed alive.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      When I had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought proper to remove\n      my body from the gallows;—this the more especially as the real\n      culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized, a fact which I\n      was so unlucky as not to know.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and as no one made\n      claim to my corpse, it was ordered that I should be interred in a public\n      vault.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Here, after due interval, I was deposited. The sexton departed, and I was\n      left alone. A line of Marston’s “Malcontent”—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      Death’s a good fellow and keeps open house—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      struck me at that moment as a palpable lie.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out. The place\n      was dreadfully dreary and damp, and I became troubled with ennui. By way\n      of amusement, I felt my way among the numerous coffins ranged in order\n      around. I lifted them down, one by one, and breaking open their lids,\n      busied myself in speculations about the mortality within.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This,” I soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated, and\n      rotund—“this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the word, an\n      unhappy—an unfortunate man. It has been his terrible lot not to walk\n      but to waddle—to pass through life not like a human being, but like\n      an elephant—not like a man, but like a rhinoceros.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and his\n      circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. Taking a step forward, it\n      has been his misfortune to take two toward the right, and three toward the\n      left. His studies have been confined to the poetry of Crabbe. He can have\n      no idea of the wonder of a pirouette. To him a pas de papillon has been an\n      abstract conception. He has never ascended the summit of a hill. He has\n      never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis. Heat has been\n      his mortal enemy. In the dog-days his days have been the days of a dog.\n      Therein, he has dreamed of flames and suffocation—of mountains upon\n      mountains—of Pelion upon Ossa. He was short of breath—to say\n      all in a word, he was short of breath. He thought it extravagant to play\n      upon wind instruments. He was the inventor of self-moving fans,\n      wind-sails, and ventilators. He patronized Du Pont the bellows-maker, and\n      he died miserably in attempting to smoke a cigar. His was a case in which\n      I feel a deep interest—a lot in which I sincerely sympathize.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But here,”—said I—“here”—and I dragged spitefully from\n      its receptacle a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose remarkable\n      appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome familiarity—“here is\n      a wretch entitled to no earthly commiseration.” Thus saying, in order to\n      obtain a more distinct view of my subject, I applied my thumb and\n      forefinger to its nose, and causing it to assume a sitting position upon\n      the ground, held it thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued my\n      soliloquy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Entitled,” I repeated, “to no earthly commiseration. Who indeed would\n      think of compassioning a shadow? Besides, has he not had his full share of\n      the blessings of mortality? He was the originator of tall monuments—shot-towers—lightning-rods—Lombardy\n      poplars. His treatise upon “Shades and Shadows” has immortalized him. He\n      edited with distinguished ability the last edition of “South on the\n      Bones.” He went early to college and studied pneumatics. He then came\n      home, talked eternally, and played upon the French-horn. He patronized the\n      bagpipes. Captain Barclay, who walked against Time, would not walk against\n      him. Windham and Allbreath were his favorite writers,—his favorite\n      artist, Phiz. He died gloriously while inhaling gas—levique flatu\n      corrupitur, like the fama pudicitae in Hieronymus. {*1} He was indubitably\n      a—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n“How can you?—how—can—you?”—interrupted the\nobject of my animadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a\ndesperate exertion, the bandage around its jaws—“how can you, Mr.\nLackobreath, be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose?\nDid you not see how they had fastened up my mouth—and you must\nknow—if you know any thing—how vast a superfluity of breath I have\nto dispose of! If you do not know, however, sit down and you shall see. In my\nsituation it is really a great relief to be able to open ones mouth—to be\nable to expatiate—to be able to communicate with a person like yourself,\nwho do not think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread\nof a gentleman’s discourse. Interruptions are annoying and should\nundoubtedly be abolished—don’t you think so?—no reply, I beg\nyou,—one person is enough to be speaking at a time.—I shall be done\nby and by, and then you may begin.—How the devil sir, did you get into\nthis place?—not a word I beseech you—been here some time\nmyself—terrible accident!—heard of it, I suppose?—awful\ncalamity!—walking under your windows—some short while\nago—about the time you were stage-struck—horrible\noccurrence!—heard of “catching one’s breath,”\neh?—hold your tongue I tell you!—I caught somebody\nelse’s!—had always too much of my own—met Blab at the corner\nof the street—wouldn’t give me a chance for a\nword—couldn’t get in a syllable edgeways—attacked,\nconsequently, with epilepsis—Blab made his escape—damn all\nfools!—they took me up for dead, and put me in this place—pretty\ndoings all of them!—heard all you said about me—every word a\nlie—horrible!—wonderful!—outrageous!—hideous!—incomprehensible!—et\ncetera—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a\n      discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced that the\n      breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I soon recognized as\n      my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the identical expiration mislaid by\n      myself in the conversation with my wife. Time, place, and circumstances\n      rendered it a matter beyond question. I did not, however, immediately\n      release my hold upon Mr. W.’s proboscis—not at least during\n      the long period in which the inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to\n      favor me with his explanations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which has ever\n      been my predominating trait. I reflected that many difficulties might\n      still lie in the path of my preservation which only extreme exertion on my\n      part would be able to surmount. Many persons, I considered, are prone to\n      estimate commodities in their possession—however valueless to the\n      then proprietor—however troublesome, or distressing—in direct\n      ratio with the advantages to be derived by others from their attainment,\n      or by themselves from their abandonment. Might not this be the case with\n      Mr. Windenough? In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at\n      present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to the\n      exactions of his avarice? There are scoundrels in this world, I remembered\n      with a sigh, who will not scruple to take unfair opportunities with even a\n      next door neighbor, and (this remark is from Epictetus) it is precisely at\n      that time when men are most anxious to throw off the burden of their own\n      calamities that they feel the least desirous of relieving them in others.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my grasp upon\n      the nose of Mr. W., I accordingly thought proper to model my reply.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Monster!” I began in a tone of the deepest indignation—“monster and\n      double-winded idiot!—dost thou, whom for thine iniquities it has\n      pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold respimtion—dost thou, I\n      say, presume to address me in the familiar language of an old\n      acquaintance?—‘I lie,’ forsooth! and ‘hold my tongue,’ to be sure!—pretty\n      conversation indeed, to a gentleman with a single breath!—all this,\n      too, when I have it in my power to relieve the calamity under which thou\n      dost so justly suffer—to curtail the superfluities of thine unhappy\n      respiration.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Like Brutus, I paused for a reply—with which, like a tornado, Mr.\n      Windenough immediately overwhelmed me. Protestation followed upon\n      protestation, and apology upon apology. There were no terms with which he\n      was unwilling to comply, and there were none of which I failed to take the\n      fullest advantage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance delivered me the\n      respiration; for which (having carefully examined it) I gave him afterward\n      a receipt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speaking in a manner\n      so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. It will be thought that I\n      should have entered more minutely, into the details of an occurrence by\n      which—and this is very true—much new light might be thrown\n      upon a highly interesting branch of physical philosophy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply. A hint is the only answer\n      which I am permitted to make. There were circumstances—but I think\n      it much safer upon consideration to say as little as possible about an\n      affair so delicate—so delicate, I repeat, and at the time involving\n      the interests of a third party whose sulphurous resentment I have not the\n      least desire, at this moment, of incurring.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an escape\n      from the dungeons of the sepulchre. The united strength of our\n      resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent. Scissors, the Whig\n      editor, republished a treatise upon “the nature and origin of subterranean\n      noises.” A reply—rejoinder—confutation—and justification—followed\n      in the columns of a Democratic gazette. It was not until the opening of\n      the vault to decide the controversy, that the appearance of Mr. Windenough\n      and myself proved both parties to have been decidedly in the wrong.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in a life\n      at all times sufficiently eventful, without again recalling to the\n      attention of the reader the merits of that indiscriminate philosophy which\n      is a sure and ready shield against those shafts of calamity which can\n      neither be seen, felt nor fully understood. It was in the spirit of this\n      wisdom that, among the ancient Hebrews, it was believed the gates of\n      Heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with good\n      lungs and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word “Amen!” It was\n      in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great plague raged at Athens,\n      and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal, Epimenides, as\n      Laërtius relates, in his second book, of that philosopher, advised the\n      erection of a shrine and temple “to the proper God.”\n     </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      L<small>YTTLETON</small> B<small>ARRY</small>.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.16\"></a>THE MAN THAT WAS USED UP</h2>\n<h3>A TALE OF THE LATE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN.</h3>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n<i>Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux, et fondez vous en eau!</i><br>\n<i>La moitié de ma vie a mis l’ autre au tombeau.</i><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—C<small>ORNEILLE</small>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      I cannot just now remember when or where I first made the acquaintance of\n      that truly fine-looking fellow, Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.\n      Smith. Some one <i>did</i> introduce me to the gentleman, I am sure—at\n      some public meeting, I know very well—held about something of great\n      importance, no doubt—at some place or other, I feel convinced,—whose\n      name I have unaccountably forgotten. The truth is—that the\n      introduction was attended, upon my part, with a degree of anxious\n      embarrassment which operated to prevent any definite impressions of either\n      time or place. I am constitutionally nervous—this, with me, is a\n      family failing, and I can’t help it. In especial, the slightest appearance\n      of mystery—of any point I cannot exactly comprehend—puts me at\n      once into a pitiable state of agitation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was something, as it were, remarkable—yes, <i>remarkable</i>,\n      although this is but a feeble term to express my full meaning—about\n      the entire individuality of the personage in question. He was, perhaps,\n      six feet in height, and of a presence singularly commanding. There was an\n      <i>air distingué</i> pervading the whole man, which spoke of high\n      breeding, and hinted at high birth. Upon this topic—the topic of\n      Smith’s personal appearance—I have a kind of melancholy satisfaction\n      in being minute. His head of hair would have done honor to a Brutus; nothing\n      could be more richly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss. It was of a\n      jetty black;—which was also the color, or more properly the no color\n      of his unimaginable whiskers. You perceive I cannot speak of these latter\n      without enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they were the\n      handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun. At all events, they encircled,\n      and at times partially overshadowed, a mouth utterly unequalled. Here were\n      the most entirely even, and the most brilliantly white of all conceivable\n      teeth. From between them, upon every proper occasion, issued a voice of\n      surpassing clearness, melody, and strength. In the matter of eyes, also,\n      my acquaintance was pre-eminently endowed. Either one of such a pair was\n      worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs. They were of a deep hazel,\n      exceedingly large and lustrous; and there was perceptible about them, ever\n      and anon, just that amount of interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy\n      to expression.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I ever saw. For\n      your life you could not have found a fault with its wonderful proportion.\n      This rare peculiarity set off to great advantage a pair of shoulders which\n      would have called up a blush of conscious inferiority into the countenance\n      of the marble Apollo. I have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say\n      that I never beheld them in perfection before. The arms altogether were\n      admirably modelled. Nor were the lower limbs less superb. These were,\n      indeed, the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of good legs. Every connoisseur in such\n      matters admitted the legs to be good. There was neither too much flesh,\n      nor too little,—neither rudeness nor fragility. I could not imagine\n      a more graceful curve than that of the <i>os femoris</i>, and there was\n      just that due gentle prominence in the rear of the <i>fibula</i> which\n      goes to the conformation of a properly proportioned calf. I wish to God my\n      young and talented friend Chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen the\n      legs of Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty as\n      reasons or blackberries, still I could not bring myself to believe that <i>the\n      remarkable</i> something to which I alluded just now,—that the odd\n      air of <i>je ne sais quoi</i> which hung about my new acquaintance,—lay\n      altogether, or indeed at all, in the supreme excellence of his bodily\n      endowments. Perhaps it might be traced to the <i>manner</i>;—yet\n      here again I could not pretend to be positive. There <i>was</i> a\n      primness, not to say stiffness, in his carriage—a degree of\n      measured, and, if I may so express it, of rectangular precision, attending\n      his every movement, which, observed in a more diminutive figure, would\n      have had the least little savor in the world, of affectation, pomposity or\n      constraint, but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted dimensions,\n      was readily placed to the account of reserve, <i>hauteur</i>—of a\n      commendable sense, in short, of what is due to the dignity of colossal\n      proportion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in my ear some\n      few words of comment upon the man. He was a <i>remarkable</i> man—a\n      <i>very</i> remarkable man—indeed one of the <i>most</i> remarkable\n      men of the age. He was an especial favorite, too, with the ladies—chiefly\n      on account of his high reputation for courage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In <i>that</i> point he is unrivalled—indeed he is a perfect\n      desperado—a down-right fire-eater, and no mistake,” said my friend,\n      here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me with the mystery\n      of his tone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A downright fire-eater, and <i>no</i> mistake. Showed <i>that</i>, I\n      should say, to some purpose, in the late tremendous swamp-fight away down\n      South, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians.” [Here my friend opened his\n      eyes to some extent.] “Bless my soul!—blood and thunder, and all\n      that!—<i>prodigies</i> of valor!—heard of him of course?—you\n      know he’s the man—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Man alive, how <i>do</i> you do? why, how <i>are</i> ye? <i>very</i> glad\n      to see ye, indeed!” here interrupted the General himself, seizing my\n      companion by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiffly, but profoundly,\n      as I was presented. I then thought, (and I think so still,) that I never\n      heard a clearer nor a stronger voice, nor beheld a finer set of teeth: but\n      I <i>must</i> say that I was sorry for the interruption just at that\n      moment, as, owing to the whispers and insinuations aforesaid, my interest\n      had been greatly excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      However, the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet Brigadier\n      General John A. B. C. Smith soon completely dissipated this chagrin. My\n      friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a long <i>tête-à-tête</i>, and\n      I was not only pleased but <i>really</i>—instructed. I never heard a\n      more fluent talker, or a man of greater general information. With becoming\n      modesty, he forebore, nevertheless, to touch upon the theme I had just\n      then most at heart—I mean the mysterious circumstances attending the\n      Bugaboo war—and, on my own part, what I conceive to be a proper\n      sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject; although, in truth, I\n      was exceedingly tempted to do so. I perceived, too, that the gallant\n      soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest, and that he delighted,\n      especially, in commenting upon the rapid march of mechanical invention.\n      Indeed, lead him where I would, this was a point to which he invariably\n      came back.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There is nothing at all like it,” he would say; “we are a wonderful\n      people, and live in a wonderful age. Parachutes and rail-roads—man-traps\n      and spring-guns! Our steam-boats are upon every sea, and the Nassau\n      balloon packet is about to run regular trips (fare either way only twenty\n      pounds sterling) between London and Timbuctoo. And who shall calculate the\n      immense influence upon social life—upon arts—upon commerce—upon\n      literature—which will be the immediate result of the great\n      principles of electro-magnetics! Nor, is this all, let me assure you!\n      There is really no end to the march of invention. The most wonderful—the\n      most ingenious—and let me add, Mr.—Mr.—Thompson, I\n      believe, is your name—let me add, I say, the most <i>useful</i>—the\n      most truly <i>useful</i>—mechanical contrivances, are daily springing up\n      like mushrooms, if I may so express myself, or, more figuratively, like—ah—grasshoppers—like\n      grasshoppers, Mr. Thompson—about us and ah—ah—ah—around\n      us!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say that I\n      left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man, with an exalted\n      opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep sense of the valuable\n      privileges we enjoy in living in this age of mechanical invention. My\n      curiosity, however, had not been altogether satisfied, and I resolved to\n      prosecute immediate inquiry among my acquaintances touching the Brevet\n      Brigadier General himself, and particularly respecting the tremendous\n      events <i>quorum pars magna fuit</i>, during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo\n      campaign.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The first opportunity which presented itself, and which (<i>horresco\n      referens</i>) I did not in the least scruple to seize, occurred at the\n      Church of the Reverend Doctor Drummummupp, where I found myself\n      established, one Sunday, just at sermon time, not only in the pew, but by\n      the side, of that worthy and communicative little friend of mine, Miss\n      Tabitha T. Thus seated, I congratulated myself, and with much reason, upon\n      the very flattering state of affairs. If any person knew anything about\n      Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, that person, it was clear to\n      me, was Miss Tabitha T. We telegraphed a few signals, and then commenced,\n      <i>sotto voce</i>, a brisk <i>tête-à-tête</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” said she, in reply to my very earnest inquiry; “Smith!—why,\n      not General John A. B. C.? Bless me, I thought you <i>knew</i> all about\n      <i>him!</i> This is a wonderfully inventive age! Horrid affair that!—a\n      bloody set of wretches, those Kickapoos!—fought like a hero—prodigies\n      of valor—immortal renown. Smith!—Brevet Brigadier General John\n      A. B. C.! why, you know he’s the man—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Man,” here broke in Doctor Drummummupp, at the top of his voice, and with\n      a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our ears—“man that is\n      born of a woman hath but a short time to live; he cometh up and is cut\n      down like a flower!” I started to the extremity of the pew, and perceived\n      by the animated looks of the divine, that the wrath which had nearly\n      proved fatal to the pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady\n      and myself. There was no help for it; so I submitted with a good grace,\n      and listened, in all the martyrdom of dignified silence, to the balance of\n      that very capital discourse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the Rantipole Theatre,\n      where I felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once, by merely stepping\n      into the box of those exquisite specimens of affability and omniscience,\n      the Misses Arabella and Miranda Cognoscenti. That fine tragedian, Climax,\n      was doing Iago to a very crowded house, and I experienced some little\n      difficulty in making my wishes understood; especially, as our box was next\n      the slips, and completely overlooked the stage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” said Miss Arabella, as she at length comprehended the purport of\n      my query; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” inquired Miranda, musingly. “God bless me, did you ever behold a\n      finer figure?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Never, madam, but <i>do</i> tell me—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Or so inimitable grace?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Never, upon my word!—But pray inform me—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Or so just an appreciation of stage effect?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Madam!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of Shakespeare? Be so good\n      as to look at that leg!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The devil!” and I turned again to her sister.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” said she, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid affair that,\n      wasn’t it?—great wretches, those Bugaboos—savage and so on—but\n      we live in a wonderfully inventive age!—Smith!—O yes! great\n      man!—perfect desperado!—immortal renown!—prodigies of\n      valor! <i>Never heard!</i>” [This was given in a scream.] “Bless my soul!\n      why, he’s the man—”\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n                         “——mandragora<br>\n     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world<br>\n     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br>\n     Which thou owd’st yesterday!”\n</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      here roared our Climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in my face all\n      the time, in a way that I <i>couldn’t</i> stand, and I <i>wouldn’t</i>. I\n      left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately, went behind the scenes forthwith,\n      and gave the beggarly scoundrel such a thrashing as I trust he will\n      remember to the day of his death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the <i>soirée</i> of the lovely widow, Mrs. Kathleen O’Trump, I was\n      confident that I should meet with no similar disappointment. Accordingly,\n      I was no sooner seated at the card-table, with my pretty hostess for a <i>vis-à-vis</i>,\n      than I propounded those questions the solution of which had become a\n      matter so essential to my peace.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” said my partner, “why, not General John A. B.\n      C.? Horrid affair that, wasn’t it?—diamonds, did you\n      say?—terrible wretches those Kickapoos!—we are playing\n      <i>whist</i>, if you please, Mr. Tattle—however, this is the age of\n      invention, most certainly <i>the</i> age, one may say—<i>the</i>\n      age <i>par excellence</i>—speak French?—oh, quite a\n      hero—perfect desperado!—<i>no hearts</i>, Mr. Tattle? I\n      don’t believe it.—immortal renown and all\n      that!—prodigies of valor! <i>Never heard!!</i>—why, bless me,\n      he’s the man—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mann!—<i>Captain</i> Mann?” here screamed some little feminine\n      interloper from the farthest corner of the room. “Are you talking about\n      Captain Mann and the duel?—oh, I <i>must</i> hear—do tell—go\n      on, Mrs. O’Trump!—do now go on!” And go on Mrs. O’Trump did—all\n      about a certain Captain Mann, who was either shot or hung, or should have\n      been both shot and hung. Yes! Mrs. O’Trump, she went on, and I—I\n      went off. There was no chance of hearing anything farther that evening in\n      regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Still I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill luck\n      would not run against me forever, and so determined to make a bold push\n      for information at the rout of that bewitching little angel, the graceful\n      Mrs. Pirouette.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” said Mrs. P., as we twirled about together in a <i>pas de zephyr</i>,\n      “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Dreadful business that of\n      the Bugaboos, wasn’t it?—dreadful creatures, those Indians!—<i>do</i>\n      turn out your toes! I really am ashamed of you—man of great courage,\n      poor fellow!—but this is a wonderful age for invention—O dear\n      me, I’m out of breath—quite a desperado—prodigies of valor—<i>never\n      heard!</i>—can’t believe it—I shall have to sit down and\n      enlighten you—Smith! why, he’s the man—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Man-<i>Fred</i>, I tell you!” here bawled out Miss Bas-Bleu, as I led\n      Mrs. Pirouette to a seat. “Did ever anybody hear the like? It’s Man-<i>Fred</i>,\n      I say, and not at all by any means Man-<i>Friday</i>.” Here Miss Bas-Bleu\n      beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner; and I was obliged, will I nill\n      I, to leave Mrs. P. for the purpose of deciding a dispute touching the\n      title of a certain poetical drama of Lord Byron’s. Although I pronounced,\n      with great promptness, that the true title was Man-<i>Friday</i>, and not\n      by any means Man-<i>Fred</i>, yet when I returned to seek Mrs. Pirouette\n      she was not to be discovered, and I made my retreat from the house in a\n      very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the Bas-Bleus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and I resolved to call at\n      once upon my particular friend, Mr. Theodore Sinivate; for I knew that\n      here at least I should get something like definite information.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Smith!” said he, in his well-known peculiar way of drawling out his\n      syllables; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Savage affair\n      that with the Kickapo-o-o-os, wasn’t it? Say! don’t you think so?—perfect\n      despera-a-ado—great pity, ‘pon my honor!—wonderfully inventive\n      age!—pro-o-odigies of valor! By the by, did you ever hear about\n      Captain Ma-a-a-a-n?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Captain Mann be d—d!” said I; “please to go on with your story.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Hem!—oh well!—quite <i>la même cho-o-ose</i>, as we say in\n      France. Smith, eh? Brigadier-General John A.—B.—C.? I say”—[here Mr.\n      S. thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose]—“I say,\n      you don’t mean to insinuate now, really and truly, and conscientiously,\n      that you don’t know all about that affair of Smith’s, as well as I do, eh?\n      Smith? John A—B—C.? Why, bless me, he’s the ma-a-an—”\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Mr</i>. Sinivate,” said I, imploringly, “<i>is</i> he the man in the\n      mask?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No-o-o!” said he, looking wise, “nor the man in the mo-o-on.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      This reply I considered a pointed and positive insult, and so left the\n      house at once in high dudgeon, with a firm resolve to call my friend, Mr.\n      Sinivate, to a speedy account for his ungentlemanly conduct and\n      ill-breeding.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime, however, I had no notion of being thwarted touching the\n      information I desired. There was one resource left me yet. I would go to\n      the fountain-head. I would call forthwith upon the General himself, and\n      demand, in explicit terms, a solution of this abominable piece of mystery.\n      Here, at least, there should be no chance for equivocation. I would be\n      plain, positive, peremptory—as short as pie-crust—as concise\n      as Tacitus or Montesquieu.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was early when I called, and the General was dressing; but I pleaded\n      urgent business, and was shown at once into his bed-room by an old negro\n      valet, who remained in attendance during my visit. As I entered the\n      chamber, I looked about, of course, for the occupant, but did not\n      immediately perceive him. There was a large and exceedingly odd-looking\n      bundle of something which lay close by my feet on the floor, and, as I was\n      not in the best humor in the world, I gave it a kick out of the way.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hem! ahem! rather civil that, I should say!” said the bundle, in one of\n      the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices, between a squeak\n      and a whistle, that I ever heard in all the days of my existence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ahem! rather civil that, I should observe.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I fairly shouted with terror, and made off, at a tangent, into the\n      farthest extremity of the room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “God bless me! my dear fellow,” here again whistled the bundle, “what—what—what—why,\n      what <i>is</i> the matter? I really believe you don’t know me at all.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      What <i>could</i> I say to all this—what <i>could</i> I? I staggered\n      into an arm-chair, and, with staring eyes and open mouth, awaited the\n      solution of the wonder.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Strange you shouldn’t know me though, isn’t it?” presently re-squeaked\n      the nondescript, which I now perceived was performing, upon the floor,\n      some inexplicable evolution, very analogous to the drawing on of a\n      stocking. There was only a single leg, however, apparent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Strange you shouldn’t know me, though, isn’t it? Pompey, bring me that\n      leg!” Here Pompey handed the bundle, a very capital cork leg, already\n      dressed, which it screwed on in a trice; and then it stood up before my\n      eyes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And a bloody action it <i>was</i>,” continued the thing, as if in a\n      soliloquy; “but then one mustn’t fight with the Bugaboos and Kickapoos,\n      and think of coming off with a mere scratch. Pompey, I’ll thank you now\n      for that arm. Thomas” [turning to me] “is decidedly the best hand at a\n      cork leg; but if you should ever want an arm, my dear fellow, you must\n      really let me recommend you to Bishop.” Here Pompey screwed on an arm.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We had rather hot work of it, that you may say. Now, you dog, slip on my\n      shoulders and bosom! Pettitt makes the best shoulders, but for a bosom you\n      will have to go to Ducrow.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Bosom!” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Pompey, will you <i>never</i> be ready with that wig? Scalping is a rough\n      process after all; but then you can procure such a capital scratch at De\n      L’Orme’s.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Scratch!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Now, you nigger, my teeth! For a <i>good</i> set of these you had better\n      go to Parmly’s at once; high prices, but excellent work. I swallowed some\n      very capital articles, though, when the big Bugaboo rammed me down with\n      the butt end of his rifle.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Butt end! ram down!! my eye!!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “O yes, by-the-by, my eye—here, Pompey, you scamp, screw it in !\n      Those Kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge; but he’s a belied man,\n      that Dr. Williams, after all; you can’t imagine how well I see with the\n      eyes of his make.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me was nothing\n      more nor less than my new acquaintance, Brevet Brigadier General John A.\n      B. C. Smith. The manipulations of Pompey had made, I must confess, a very\n      striking difference in the appearance of the personal man. The voice,\n      however, still puzzled me no little; but even this apparent mystery was\n      speedily cleared up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Pompey, you black rascal,” squeaked the General, “I really do believe you\n      would let me go out without my palate.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon, the negro, grumbling out an apology, went up to his master,\n      opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse-jockey, and adjusted\n      therein a somewhat singular-looking machine, in a very dexterous manner,\n      that I could not altogether comprehend. The alteration, however, in the\n      entire expression of the General’s countenance was instantaneous and\n      surprising. When he again spoke, his voice had resumed all that rich\n      melody and strength which I had noticed upon our original introduction.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “D—n the vagabonds!” said he, in so clear a tone that I positively\n      started at the change, “D—n the vagabonds! they not only knocked in\n      the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut off at least\n      seven-eighths of my tongue. There isn’t Bonfanti’s equal, however, in\n      America, for really good articles of this description. I can recommend you\n      to him with confidence,” [here the General bowed,] “and assure you that I\n      have the greatest pleasure in so doing.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I acknowledged his kindness in my best manner, and took leave of him at\n      once, with a perfect understanding of the true state of affairs—with\n      a full comprehension of the mystery which had troubled me so long. It was\n      evident. It was a clear case. Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith\n      was the man—was <i>the man that was used up</i>.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.17\"></a>THE BUSINESS MAN</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\nMethod is the soul of business.—O<small>LD</small> S<small>AYING</small>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      I am a business man. I am a methodical man. Method is the thing, after\n      all. But there are no people I more heartily despise than your eccentric\n      fools who prate about method without understanding it; attending strictly\n      to its letter, and violating its spirit. These fellows are always doing\n      the most out-of-the-way things in what they call an orderly manner. Now\n      here, I conceive, is a positive paradox. True method appertains to the\n      ordinary and the obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the <i>outré</i>. What\n      definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as “methodical Jack o’\n      Dandy,” or “a systematical Will o’ the Wisp”?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they are, but\n      for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was a very little\n      boy. A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall not forget in my will)\n      took me up one day by the heels, when I was making more noise than was\n      necessary, and swinging me round two or three times, d—d my eyes\n      for “a skreeking little spalpeen,” and then knocked my head\n      into a cocked hat against the bedpost. This, I say, decided my fate, and\n      made my fortune. A bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to\n      be as pretty an organ of order as one shall see on a summer’s day.\n      Hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me\n      the distinguished man of business that I am.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      If there is any thing on earth I hate, it is a genius. Your geniuses are\n      all arrant asses—the greater the genius the greater the ass—and\n      to this rule there is no exception whatever. Especially, you cannot make a\n      man of business out of a genius, any more than money out of a Jew, or the\n      best nutmegs out of pine-knots. The creatures are always going off at a\n      tangent into some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation,\n      entirely at variance with the “fitness of things,” and having no business\n      whatever to be considered as a business at all. Thus you may tell these\n      characters immediately by the nature of their occupations. If you ever\n      perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a manufacturer, or going into\n      the cotton or tobacco trade, or any of those eccentric pursuits; or\n      getting to be a drygoods dealer, or soap-boiler, or something of that\n      kind; or pretending to be a lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician—any\n      thing out of the usual way—you may set him down at once as a genius,\n      and then, according to the rule-of-three, he’s an ass.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now I am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man. My\n      day-book and ledger will evince this in a minute. They are well kept,\n      though I say it myself; and, in my general habits of accuracy and\n      punctuality, I am not to be beat by a clock. Moreover, my occupations have\n      been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen.\n      Not that I feel the least indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly\n      weak-minded parents, who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius\n      of me at last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the\n      rescue. In biography the truth is every thing, and in autobiography it is\n      especially so—yet I scarcely hope to be believed when I state,\n      however solemnly, that my poor father put me, when I was about fifteen\n      years of age, into the counting-house of what be termed “a respectable\n      hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business!” A\n      capital bit of fiddlestick! However, the consequence of this folly was,\n      that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my button-headed\n      family in a high state of fever, and with a most violent and dangerous\n      pain in the sinciput, all around about my organ of order. It was nearly a\n      gone case with me then—just touch-and-go for six weeks—the\n      physicians giving me up and all that sort of thing. But, although I\n      suffered much, I was a thankful boy in the main. I was saved from being a\n      “respectable hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of\n      business,” and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been the\n      means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female who had\n      originally put these means within my reach.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age, but I\n      waited till I was sixteen. I don’t know that I should have gone even then,\n      if I had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my\n      own hook in the grocery way. The grocery way!—only think of that! I\n      resolved to be off forthwith, and try and establish myself in some decent\n      occupation, without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of\n      these eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius of\n      in the end. In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the first\n      effort, and by the time I was fairly eighteen, found myself doing an\n      extensive and profitable business in the Tailor’s Walking-Advertisement\n      line.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession, only by\n      that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading feature of my\n      mind. A scrupulous method characterized my actions as well as my accounts.\n      In my case it was method—not money—which made the man: at\n      least all of him that was not made by the tailor whom I served. At nine,\n      every morning, I called upon that individual for the clothes of the day.\n      Ten o’clock found me in some fashionable promenade or other place of\n      public amusement. The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome\n      person about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the\n      suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in the trade.\n      Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer to the house of my\n      employers, Messrs. Cut &amp; Comeagain. I say this proudly, but with tears\n      in my eyes—for the firm proved themselves the basest of ingrates.\n      The little account, about which we quarreled and finally parted, cannot,\n      in any item, be thought overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with\n      the nature of the business. Upon this point, however, I feel a degree of\n      proud satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself. My bill\n      ran thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n<i>Messrs. Cut &amp; Comeagain, Merchant Tailors.<br>\nTo Peter Proffit, Walking Advertiser,</i> Drs.\n</p>\n<table style=\"\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 10.</td><td>to promenade, as usual and customer brought home</td><td>$00 25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>July 11.</td><td>To do do do</td><td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>July 12.</td><td>To one lie, second class; damaged black cloth sold for\ninvisible green</td><td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>July 13.</td><td>To one lie, first class, extra quality and size;\nrecommended milled satinet as broadcloth,</td><td>75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>July 20.</td><td>To purchasing bran new paper shirt collar or dickey, to\nset off gray Petersham</td><td>02</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug. 15.</td><td>To wearing double-padded bobtail frock, (thermometer 106\nin the shade)</td><td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug. 16.</td><td>Standing on one leg three hours, to show off new-style\nstrapped pants at 12 1/2 cents per leg per hour</td><td>37½</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug. 17.</td><td>To promenade, as usual, and large customer brought (fat\nman)</td><td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug. 18.</td><td>To do do (medium size)</td><td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug. 19.</td><td>To do do (small man and bad pay)</td><td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>$2 95½</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>\n      The item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two\n      pennies for the dickey. Upon my word of honor, this was not an\n      unreasonable price for that dickey. It was one of the cleanest and\n      prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good reason to believe\n      that it effected the sale of three Petershams. The elder partner of the\n      firm, however, would allow me only one penny of the charge, and took it\n      upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences\n      could be got out of a sheet of foolscap. But it is needless to say that I\n      stood upon the principle of the thing. Business is business, and should be\n      done in a business way. There was no system whatever in swindling me out\n      of a penny—a clear fraud of fifty per cent—no method in any\n      respect. I left at once the employment of Messrs. Cut &amp; Comeagain, and\n      set up in the Eye-Sore line by myself—one of the most lucrative,\n      respectable, and independent of the ordinary occupations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here again\n      came into play. I found myself driving a flourishing trade, and soon\n      became a marked man upon “Change.” The truth is, I never\n      dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober routine of\n      the calling—a calling in which I should, no doubt, have remained to\n      the present hour, but for a little accident which happened to me in the\n      prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession.\n      Whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets\n      into the notion of putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the\n      world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person\n      knows. The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade. As\n      soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one of these\n      parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation,\n      or a prime little situation just adjoining, or tight in front. This done,\n      we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty\n      architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a\n      Down-East or Dutch Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of\n      fancy work, either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. Of course we\n      can’t afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five\n      hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. Can we? I\n      ask the question. I ask it of business men. It would be irrational to\n      suppose that we can. And yet there was a rascally corporation which asked\n      me to do this very thing—this very thing! I did not reply to their\n      absurd proposition, of course; but I felt it a duty to go that same\n      night, and lamp-black the whole of their palace. For this the\n      unreasonable villains clapped me into jail; and the gentlemen of the\n      Eye-Sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when I came\n      out.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to adventure\n      for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the delicate nature of my\n      constitution; but I went to work in it with a good heart, and found my\n      account here, as heretofore, in those stern habits of methodical accuracy\n      which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse—I would\n      indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will. By\n      observing, as I say, the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping\n      a well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many serious\n      difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very decently in the\n      profession. The truth is, that few individuals, in any line, did a snugger\n      little business than I. I will just copy a page or so out of my Day-Book;\n      and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet—a\n      contemptible practice of which no high-minded man will be guilty. Now, the\n      Day-Book is a thing that don’t lie.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Jan. 1.—New Year’s Day. Met Snap in the street, groggy. Mem—he’ll\n      do. Met Gruff shortly afterward, blind drunk. Mem—he’ll answer, too.\n      Entered both gentlemen in my Ledger, and opened a running account with\n      each.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Jan. 2.—Saw Snap at the Exchange, and went up and trod on his toe.\n      Doubled his fist and knocked me down. Good!—got up again. Some\n      trifling difficulty with Bag, my attorney. I want the damages at a\n      thousand, but he says that for so simple a knock down we can’t lay them at\n      more than five hundred. Mem—must get rid of Bag—no system at\n      all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Jan. 3.—Went to the theatre, to look for Gruff. Saw him\n      sitting in a side box, in the second tier, between a fat lady and a lean\n      one. Quizzed the whole party through an opera-glass, till I saw the fat\n      lady blush and whisper to G. Went round, then, into the box, and put my\n      nose within reach of his hand. Wouldn’t pull it—no go. Blew\n      it, and tried again—no go. Sat down then, and winked at the lean\n      lady, when I had the high satisfaction of finding him lift me up by the\n      nape of the neck, and fling me over into the pit. Neck dislocated, and\n      right leg capitally splintered. Went home in high glee, drank a bottle of\n      champagne, and booked the young man for five thousand. Bag says\n      it’ll do.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Feb. 15.—Compromised the case of Mr. Snap. Amount entered in\n      Journal—fifty cents—which see.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Feb. 16.—Cast by that ruffian, Gruff, who made me a present of five\n      dollars. Costs of suit, four dollars and twenty-five cents. Nett profit,—see\n      Journal,—seventy-five cents.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less than one\n      dollar and twenty-five cents—this is in the mere cases of Snap and\n      Gruff; and I solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at\n      random from my Day-Book.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It’s an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is nothing in\n      comparison with health. I found the exactions of the profession somewhat\n      too much for my delicate state of body; and, discovering, at last, that I\n      was knocked all out of shape, so that I didn’t know very well what to make\n      of the matter, and so that my friends, when they met me in the street,\n      couldn’t tell that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the\n      best expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business. I turned my\n      attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it for some years.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a fancy to it,\n      and the competition is in consequence excessive. Every ignoramus of a\n      fellow who finds that he hasn’t brains in sufficient quantity to make his\n      way as a walking advertiser, or an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter\n      man, thinks, of course, that he’ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud.\n      But there never was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it\n      requires no brains to mud-dabble. Especially, there is nothing to be made\n      in this way without method. I did only a retail business myself, but my\n      old habits of system carried me swimmingly along. I selected my\n      street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation, and I never\n      put down a broom in any part of the town but that. I took care, too, to\n      have a nice little puddle at hand, which I could get at in a minute. By\n      these means I got to be well known as a man to be trusted; and this is\n      one-half the battle, let me tell you, in trade. Nobody ever failed to\n      pitch me a copper, and got over my crossing with a clean pair of\n      pantaloons. And, as my business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently\n      understood, I never met with any attempt at imposition. I wouldn’t have\n      put up with it, if I had. Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered\n      no one to play the possum with me. The frauds of the banks of course I\n      couldn’t help. Their suspension put me to ruinous inconvenience. These,\n      however, are not individuals, but corporations; and corporations, it is\n      very well known, have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, I was induced\n      to merge it in the Cur-Spattering—a somewhat analogous, but, by no\n      means, so respectable a profession. My location, to be sure, was an\n      excellent one, being central, and I had capital blacking and brushes. My\n      little dog, too, was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff. He had\n      been in the trade a long time, and, I may say, understood it. Our general\n      routine was this:—Pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat\n      upon end at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright\n      boots. He then proceeded to meet him, and gave the Wellingtons a rub or\n      two with his wool. Then the dandy swore very much, and looked about for a\n      boot-black. There I was, full in his view, with blacking and brushes. It\n      was only a minute’s work, and then came a sixpence. This did moderately\n      well for a time;—in fact, I was not avaricious, but my dog was. I\n      allowed him a third of the profit, but he was advised to insist upon half.\n      This I couldn’t stand—so we quarrelled and parted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I next tried my hand at the Organ-Grinding for a while, and may say that I\n      made out pretty well. It is a plain, straightforward business, and\n      requires no particular abilities. You can get a music-mill for a mere\n      song, and to put it in order, you have but to open the works, and give\n      them three or four smart raps with a hammer. It improves the tone of the\n      thing, for business purposes, more than you can imagine. This done, you\n      have only to stroll along, with the mill on your back, until you see\n      tanbark in the street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin. Then you stop\n      and grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday.\n      Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence, with a\n      request to “Hush up and go on,” etc. I am aware that some grinders have\n      actually afforded to “go on” for this sum; but for my part, I found the\n      necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my “going on” under a\n      shilling.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At this occupation I did a good deal; but, somehow, I was not quite\n      satisfied, and so finally abandoned it. The truth is, I labored under the\n      disadvantage of having no monkey—and American streets are so muddy,\n      and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive, and so full of demnition\n      mischievous little boys.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was now out of employment for some months, but at length succeeded, by\n      dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in the Sham-Post. The\n      duties, here, are simple, and not altogether unprofitable. For example:—very\n      early in the morning I had to make up my packet of sham letters. Upon the\n      inside of each of these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which\n      occurred to me as sufficiently mysterious—signing all the epistles\n      Tom Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way. Having folded and\n      sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks—New Orleans,\n      Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off—I set out,\n      forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry. I always\n      called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and receive the postage.\n      Nobody hesitates at paying for a letter—especially for a double one—people\n      are such fools—and it was no trouble to get round a corner before\n      there was time to open the epistles. The worst of this profession was,\n      that I had to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my\n      route. Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience. I can’t bear to hear\n      innocent individuals abused—and the way the whole town took to\n      cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to hear. I washed\n      my hands of the matter in disgust.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way. I have\n      found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and, really, no trouble\n      at all. The country, it is well known, has become infested with cats—so\n      much so of late, that a petition for relief, most numerously and\n      respectably signed, was brought before the Legislature at its late\n      memorable session. The Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually\n      well-informed, and, having passed many other wise and wholesome\n      enactments, it crowned all with the Cat-Act. In its original form, this\n      law offered a premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the Senate\n      succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the word\n      “tails” for “heads.” This amendment was so obviously proper, that the\n      House concurred in it nem. con.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As soon as the governor had signed the bill, I invested my whole estate in\n      the purchase of Toms and Tabbies. At first I could only afford to feed\n      them upon mice (which are cheap), but they fulfilled the scriptural\n      injunction at so marvellous a rate, that I at length considered it my best\n      policy to be liberal, and so indulged them in oysters and turtle. Their\n      tails, at a legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have\n      discovered a way, in which, by means of Macassar oil, I can force three\n      crops in a year. It delights me to find, too, that the animals soon get\n      accustomed to the thing, and would rather have the appendages cut off than\n      otherwise. I consider myself, therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for\n      a country-seat on the Hudson.\n    </p>\n",

He\n      was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever\n      lavished upon him by fortune. From his cradle to his grave, a gale of the\n      blandest prosperity bore him along. Nor do I use the word Prosperity in\n      its mere wordly or external sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness.\n      The person of whom I speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing\n      the wild doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of\n      exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the mere\n      chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of Ellison, I fancy,\n      that I have seen refuted the dogma—that in man’s physical and\n      spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of Bliss. An\n      intimate and anxious examination of his career, has taught me to\n      understand that, in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of\n      Humanity, arises the Wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have\n      in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content,—and that\n      even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great\n      question of the Social Condition, it is not impossible that Man, the\n      individual, under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be\n      happy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and thus is\n      it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which\n      distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert. It is,\n      indeed evident, that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now\n      and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would\n      have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of\n      his life, into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those of\n      preeminent endowments. But it is by no means my present object to pen an\n      essay on Happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few\n      words. He admitted but four unvarying laws, or rather elementary\n      principles, of Bliss. That which he considered chief, was (strange to\n      say!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air.\n      “The health,” he said, “attainable by other means than this is scarcely\n      worth the name.” He pointed to the tillers of the earth—the only\n      people who, as a class, are proverbially more happy than others—and\n      then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter. His second\n      principle was the love of woman. His third was the contempt of ambition.\n      His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other\n      things being equal, the extent of happiness was proportioned to the\n      spirituality of this object.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of\n      good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune. In personal grace and beauty he\n      exceeded all men. His intellect was of that order to which the attainment\n      of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition. His family\n      was one of the most illustrious of the empire. His bride was the loveliest\n      and most devoted of women. His possessions had been always ample; but,\n      upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was discovered that\n      one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had been played in his behalf\n      which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom\n      fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are\n      their objects. It appears that about one hundred years prior to Mr.\n      Ellison’s attainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote\n      province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This gentlemen had amassed a princely\n      fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the whim of\n      suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.\n      Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment, he\n      bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood, bearing the name\n      Ellison, who should be alive at the end of the hundred years. Many futile\n      attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest; their ex post\n      facto character rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous\n      government was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all\n      similar accumulations. This act did not prevent young Ellison, upon his\n      twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession, as the heir of his\n      ancestor, Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of\n      dollars. {*1}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous wealth\n      inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its\n      disposal. The gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of\n      the sum, dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic. The\n      possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to\n      perform any one of a thousand things. With riches merely surpassing those\n      of any citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme\n      excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or busying himself\n      with political intrigues; or aiming at ministerial power; or purchasing\n      increase of nobility, or devising gorgeous architectural piles; or\n      collecting large specimens of Virtu; or playing the munificent patron of\n      Letters and Art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive\n      institutions of charity. But, for the inconceivable wealth in the actual\n      possession of the young heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were\n      felt to be inadequate. Recourse was had to figures; and figures but\n      sufficed to confound. It was seen, that even at three per cent, the annual\n      income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and\n      five hundred thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and\n      twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and\n      eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour,\n      or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track\n      of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine.\n      There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself\n      forthwith of at least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous\n      opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his\n      superabundance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his\n      mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of discussion to his\n      friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In\n      the widest and noblest sense, he was a poet. He comprehended, moreover,\n      the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of\n      the poetic sentiment. The proper gratification of the sentiment he\n      instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty. Some\n      peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of his\n      intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the whole cast of\n      his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which\n      imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous, if not the\n      sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment, was to be\n      found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus\n      it happened that he became neither musician nor poet; if we use this\n      latter term in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that\n      he became neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his\n      which I have already mentioned—the idea, that in the contempt of\n      ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth. Is it\n      not, indeed, possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily\n      ambitious, the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition?\n      And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton, have\n      contentedly remained “mute and inglorious?” I believe the world has never\n      yet seen, and that, unless through some series of accidents goading the\n      noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never\n      behold, that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer\n      productions of Art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more\n      profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse. Under other circumstances\n      than those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have\n      become a painter. The field of sculpture, although in its nature rigidly\n      poetical, was too limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have\n      occupied, at any time, much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all\n      the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the poetic\n      sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating. I mean the\n      most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the\n      phrase “poetic sentiment.” But Mr. Ellison imagined that the richest, and\n      altogether the most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly\n      neglected. No definition had spoken of the Landscape-Gardener, as of the\n      poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the\n      Landscape-Garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of\n      opportunities. Here was, indeed, the fairest field for the display of\n      invention, or imagination, in the endless combining of forms of novel\n      Beauty; the elements which should enter into combination being, at all\n      times, and by a vast superiority, the most glorious which the earth could\n      afford. In the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower,\n      he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of Nature at\n      physical loveliness. And in the direction or concentration of this effort,\n      or, still more properly, in its adaption to the eyes which were to behold\n      it upon earth, he perceived that he should be employing the best means—laboring\n      to the greatest advantage—in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth.” In his\n      explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much towards solving what\n      has always seemed to me an enigma. I mean the fact (which none but the\n      ignorant dispute) that no such combinations of scenery exist in Nature as\n      the painter of genius has in his power to produce. No such Paradises are\n      to be found in reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude. In the\n      most enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect\n      or an excess—many excesses and defects. While the component parts\n      may exceed, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement\n      of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no\n      position can be attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily,\n      will not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the\n      composition of a natural landscape. And yet how unintelligible is this! In\n      all other matters we are justly instructed to regard Nature as supreme.\n      With her details we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to imitate\n      the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the\n      valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that\n      “Nature is to be exalted rather than imitated,” is in error. No pictorial\n      or sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more than\n      approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily\n      path. Byron, who often erred, erred not in saying, I’ve seen more living\n      beauty, ripe and real, than all the nonsense of their stone ideal. In\n      landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its\n      truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has\n      induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art.\n      Having, I say, felt its truth here. For the feeling is no affectation or\n      chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations, than the\n      sentiment of his Art yields to the artist. He not only believes, but\n      positively knows, that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of\n      matter, or form, constitute, and alone constitute, the true Beauty. Yet\n      his reasons have not yet been matured into expression. It remains for a\n      more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate\n      and express them. Nevertheless is he confirmed in his instinctive\n      opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers. Let a composition be\n      defective; let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form;\n      let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by each\n      will its necessity be admitted. And even far more than this, in remedy of\n      the defective composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will\n      suggest the identical emendation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone, is the\n      physical Nature susceptible of “exaltation” and that, therefore, her\n      susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery which,\n      hitherto I had been unable to solve. It was Mr. Ellison who first\n      suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of\n      the natural beauty, was really such, as respected only the mortal or human\n      point of view; that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive\n      scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we could\n      suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the\n      heavens. “It is easily understood,” says Mr. Ellison, “that what might\n      improve a closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a\n      general and more distantly observed effect.” He spoke upon this\n      topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious\n      importance (which is little), as the character of the conclusions to\n      which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which it might\n      serve to corroborate or sustain. There might be a class of beings, human\n      once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose scrutiny and for whose\n      refined appreciation of the beautiful, more especially than for our own,\n      had been set in order by God the great landscape-garden of the whole\n      earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to quote\n      some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have well treated\n      this theme.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There are, properly,” he writes, “but two styles of landscape-gardening,\n      the natural and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of\n      the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery; cultivating\n      trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;\n      detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,\n      proportion and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed\n      everywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of the natural\n      style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and\n      incongruities—in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order,\n      than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial\n      style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify. It\n      has a certain general relation to the various styles of building. There\n      are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces;\n      and a various mixed old English style, which bears some relation to the\n      domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said\n      against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of\n      pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty. This is partly\n      pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral. A\n      terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye,\n      the fair forms that have passed there in other days. The slightest\n      exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “From what I have already observed,” said Mr. Ellison, “you will\n      understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of ‘recalling the\n      original beauty of the country.’ The original beauty is never so great as\n      that which may be introduced. Of course, much depends upon the selection\n      of a spot with capabilities. What is said in respect to the ‘detecting and\n      bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and\n      color,’ is a mere vagueness of speech, which may mean much, or little, or\n      nothing, and which guides in no degree. That the true ‘result of the\n      natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects\n      and incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or\n      miracles,’ is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension\n      of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The merit\n      suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains to that hobbling criticism\n      which, in letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while\n      that merit which consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly\n      to the understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier\n      merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be\n      apprehended solely in its results. Rule applies but to the excellences of\n      avoidance—to the virtues which deny or refrain. Beyond these the\n      critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build an Odyssey,\n      but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a ‘Tempest,’ an\n      ‘Inferno,’ a ‘Prometheus Bound,’ a ‘Nightingale,’ such as that of Keats,\n      or the ‘Sensitive Plant’ of Shelley. But, the thing done, the wonder\n      accomplished, and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The\n      sophists of the negative school, who, through inability to create, have\n      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What, in its\n      chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never\n      fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their\n      instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Our author’s observations on the artificial style of gardening,”\n       continued Mr. Ellison, “are less objectionable. ‘A mixture of pure art in\n      a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.’ This is just, and the\n      reference to the sense of human interest is equally so. I repeat that the\n      principle here expressed, is incontrovertible; but there may be something\n      even beyond it. There may be an object in full keeping with the principle\n      suggested—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in\n      possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the\n      landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human\n      interest could bestow. The true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary\n      resources, might possibly, while retaining the necessary idea of art or\n      interest or culture, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty\n      of Beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will\n      be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages\n      of interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness and\n      technicality of Art. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in the most\n      savage of the scenes of pure Nature—there is apparent the art of a\n      Creator; yet is this art apparent only to reflection; in no respect has it\n      the obvious force of a feeling. Now, if we imagine this sense of the\n      Almighty Design to be harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a\n      landscape whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and\n      magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or\n      superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to\n      humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the Art\n      is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary Nature—a\n      Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but which still is\n      Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover\n      between man and God.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a\n      vision such as this—in the free exercise in the open air, which\n      resulted from personal direction of his plans—in the continuous and\n      unceasing object which these plans afforded—in the high\n      spirituality of the object itself—in the contempt of ambition\n      which it enabled him more to feel than to affect—and, lastly, it\n      was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife, that Ellison\n      thought to find, and found, an exemption from the ordinary cares of\n      Humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever\n      glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Staël.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.19\"></a>MAELZEL’S CHESS-PLAYER</h2>\n<p>\n      Perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general attention\n      as the Chess-Player of Maelzel. Wherever seen it has been an object of\n      intense curiosity, to all persons who think. Yet the question of its <i>modus\n      operandi</i> is still undetermined. Nothing has been written on this topic\n      which can be considered as decisive—and accordingly we find every\n      where men of mechanical genius, of great general acuteness, and\n      discriminative understanding, who make no scruple in pronouncing the\n      Automaton a <i>pure machine</i>, unconnected with human agency in its\n      movements, and consequently, beyond all comparison, the most astonishing\n      of the inventions of mankind. And such it would undoubtedly be, were they\n      right in their supposition. Assuming this hypothesis, it would be grossly\n      absurd to compare with the Chess-Player, any similar thing of either\n      modern or ancient days. Yet there have been many and wonderful automata.\n      In Brewster’s Letters on Natural Magic, we have an account of the most\n      remarkable. Among these may be mentioned, as having beyond doubt existed,\n      firstly, the coach invented by M. Camus for the amusement of Louis XIV\n      when a child. A table, about four feet square, was introduced, into the\n      room appropriated for the exhibition. Upon this table was placed a\n      carriage, six inches in length, made of wood, and drawn by two horses of\n      the same material. One window being down, a lady was seen on the back\n      seat. A coachman held the reins on the box, and a footman and page were in\n      their places behind. M. Camus now touched a spring; whereupon the coachman\n      smacked his whip, and the horses proceeded in a natural manner, along the\n      edge of the table, drawing after them the carriage. Having gone as far as\n      possible in this direction, a sudden turn was made to the left, and the\n      vehicle was driven at right angles to its former course, and still closely\n      along the edge of the table. In this way the coach proceeded until it\n      arrived opposite the chair of the young prince. It then stopped, the page\n      descended and opened the door, the lady alighted, and presented a petition\n      to her sovereign. She then re-entered. The page put up the steps, closed\n      the door, and resumed his station. The coachman whipped his horses, and\n      the carriage was driven back to its original position.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The magician of M. Maillardet is also worthy of notice. We copy the\n      following account of it from the <i>Letters</i> before mentioned of Dr.\n      B., who derived his information principally from the Edinburgh\n      Encyclopaedia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “One of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen, Is the\n      Magician constructed by M. Maillardet, for the purpose of answering\n      certain given questions. A figure, dressed like a magician, appears seated\n      at the bottom of a wall, holding a wand in one hand, and a book in the\n      other A number of questions, ready prepared, are inscribed on oval\n      medallions, and the spectator takes any of these he chooses and to which\n      he wishes an answer, and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it,\n      the drawer shuts with a spring till the answer is returned. The magician\n      then arises from his seat, bows his head, describes circles with his wand,\n      and consulting the book as If in deep thought, he lifts it towards his\n      face. Having thus appeared to ponder over the proposed question he raises\n      his wand, and striking with it the wall above his head, two folding doors\n      fly open, and display an appropriate answer to the question. The doors\n      again close, the magician resumes his original position, and the drawer\n      opens to return the medallion. There are twenty of these medallions, all\n      containing different questions, to which the magician returns the most\n      suitable and striking answers. The medallions are thin plates of brass, of\n      an elliptical form, exactly resembling each other. Some of the medallions\n      have a question inscribed on each side, both of which the magician\n      answered in succession. If the drawer is shut without a medallion being\n      put into it, the magician rises, consults his book, shakes his head, and\n      resumes his seat. The folding doors remain shut, and the drawer is\n      returned empty. If two medallions are put into the drawer together, an\n      answer is returned only to the lower one. When the machinery is wound up,\n      the movements continue about an hour, during which time about fifty\n      questions may be answered. The inventor stated that the means by which the\n      different medallions acted upon the machinery, so as to produce the proper\n      answers to the questions which they contained, were extremely simple.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The duck of Vaucanson was still more remarkable. It was <i>of </i>the size\n      of life, and so perfect an imitation of the living animal that all the\n      spectators were deceived. It executed, says Brewster, all the natural\n      movements and gestures, it ate and drank with avidity, performed all the\n      quick motions of the head and throat which are peculiar to the duck, and\n      like it muddled the water which it drank with its bill. It produced also\n      the sound of quacking in the most natural manner. In the anatomical\n      structure the artist exhibited the highest skill. Every bone in the real\n      duck had its representative In the automaton, and its wings were\n      anatomically exact. Every cavity, apophysis, and curvature was imitated,\n      and each bone executed its proper movements. When corn was thrown down\n      before it, the duck stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and\n      digested it. {*1}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But if these machines were ingenious, what shall we think of the\n      calculating machine of Mr. Babbage? What shall we think of an engine of\n      wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical and navigation\n      tables to any given extent, but render the exactitude of its operations\n      mathematically certain through its power of correcting its possible\n      errors? What shall we think of a machine which can not only accomplish all\n      this, but actually print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without\n      the slightest intervention of the intellect of man? It will, perhaps, be\n      said, in reply, that a machine such as we have described is altogether\n      above comparison with the Chess-Player of Maelzel. By no means—it is\n      altogether beneath it—that is to say provided we assume (what should\n      never for a moment be assumed) that the Chess-Player is a <i>pure machine,\n      </i>and performs its operations without any immediate human agency.\n      Arithmetical or algebraical calculations are, from their very nature,\n      fixed and determinate. Certain <i>data </i>being given, certain results\n      necessarily and inevitably follow. These results have dependence upon\n      nothing, and are influenced by nothing but the <i>data </i>originally\n      given. And the question to be solved proceeds, or should proceed, to its\n      final determination, by a succession of unerring steps liable to no\n      change, and subject to no modification. This being the case, we can\n      without difficulty conceive the <i>possibility </i>of so arranging a piece\n      of mechanism, that upon starting In accordance with the <i>data </i>of the\n      question to be solved, it should continue its movements regularly,\n      progressively, and undeviatingly towards the required solution, since\n      these movements, however complex, are never imagined to be otherwise than\n      finite and determinate. But the case is widely different with the\n      Chess-Player. With him there is no determinate progression. No one move in\n      chess necessarily follows upon any one other. From no particular\n      disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate their\n      disposition at a different period. Let us place the <i>first move </i>in a\n      game of chess, in juxta-position with the <i>data </i>of an algebraical\n      question, and their great difference will be immediately perceived. From\n      the latter—from the <i>data—</i>the second step of the\n      question, dependent thereupon, inevitably follows. It is modelled by the\n      <i>data. </i>It must be <i>thus </i>and not otherwise. But from the first\n      move in the game of chess no especial second move follows of necessity. In\n      the algebraical question, as it proceeds towards solution, the <i>certainty\n      </i>of its operations remains altogether unimpaired. The second step\n      having been a consequence of the <i>data, </i>the third step is equally a\n      consequence of the second, the fourth of the third, the fifth of the\n      fourth, and so on, <i>and not possibly otherwise, </i>to the end. But in\n      proportion to the progress made in a game of chess, is the <i>uncertainty\n      </i>of each ensuing move. A few moves having been made, <i>no </i>step is\n      certain. Different spectators of the game would advise different moves.\n      All is then dependent upon the variable judgment of the players. Now even\n      granting (what should not be granted) that the movements of the Automaton\n      Chess-Player were in themselves determinate, they would be necessarily\n      interrupted and disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist.\n      There is then no analogy whatever between the operations of the\n      Chess-Player, and those of the calculating machine of Mr. Babbage, and if\n      we choose to call the former a <i>pure machine </i>we must be prepared to\n      admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the most wonderful of the\n      inventions of mankind. Its original projector, however, Baron Kempelen,\n      had no scruple in declaring it to be a “very ordinary piece of mechanism—a\n      <i>bagatelle </i>whose effects appeared so marvellous only from the\n      boldness of the conception, and the fortunate choice of the methods\n      adopted for promoting the illusion.” But it is needless to dwell upon this\n      point. It is quite certain that the operations of the Automaton are\n      regulated by <i>mind, </i>and by nothing else. Indeed this matter is\n      susceptible of a mathematical demonstration, <i>a priori. </i>The only\n      question then is of the <i>manner </i>in which human agency is brought to\n      bear. Before entering upon this subject it would be as well to give a\n      brief history and description of the Chess-Player for the benefit of such\n      of our readers as may never have had an opportunity of witnessing Mr.\n      Maelzel’s exhibition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Automaton Chess-Player was invented in 1769, by Baron Kempelen, a\n      nobleman of Presburg, in Hungary, who afterwards disposed of it, together\n      with the secret of its operations, to its present possessor. {2*} Soon\n      after its completion it was exhibited in Presburg, Paris, Vienna, and\n      other continental cities. In 1783 and 1784, it was taken to London by Mr.\n      Maelzel. Of late years it has visited the principal towns in the United\n      States. Wherever seen, the most intense curiosity was excited by its\n      appearance, and numerous have been the attempts, by men of all classes, to\n      fathom the mystery of its evolutions. The cut on this page gives a\n      tolerable representation of the figure as seen by the citizens of Richmond\n      a few weeks ago. The right arm, however, should lie more at length upon\n      the box, a chess-board should appear upon it, and the cushion should not\n      be seen while the pipe is held. Some immaterial alterations have been made\n      in the costume of the player since it came into the possession of Maelzel—the\n      plume, for example, was not originally worn. {image of automaton}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the hour appointed for exhibition, a curtain is withdrawn, or folding\n      doors are thrown open, and the machine rolled to within about twelve feet\n      of the nearest of the spectators, between whom and it (the machine) a rope\n      is stretched. A figure is seen habited as a Turk, and seated, with its\n      legs crossed, at a large box apparently of maple wood, which serves it as\n      a table. The exhibiter will, if requested, roll the machine to any portion\n      of the room, suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot, or\n      even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a game. The\n      bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the floor by means of the\n      castors or brazen rollers on which it moves, a clear view of the surface\n      immediately beneath the Automaton being thus afforded to the spectators.\n      The chair on which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box. On\n      the top of this latter is a chess-board, also permanently affixed. The\n      right arm of the Chess-Player is extended at full length before him, at\n      right angles with his body, and lying, in an apparently careless position,\n      by the side of the board. The back of the hand is upwards. The board\n      itself is eighteen inches square. The left arm of the figure is bent at\n      the elbow, and in the left hand is a pipe. A green drapery conceals the\n      back of the Turk, and falls partially over the front of both shoulders. To\n      judge from the external appearance of the box, it is divided into five\n      compartments—three cupboards of equal dimensions, and two drawers\n      occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the cupboards. The\n      foregoing observations apply to the appearance of the Automaton upon its\n      first introduction into the presence of the spectators.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their view the\n      mechanism of the machine. Taking from his pocket a bunch of keys he\n      unlocks with one of them, door marked ~ in the cut above, and throws the\n      cupboard fully open to the inspection of all present. Its whole interior\n      is apparently filled with wheels, pinions, levers, and other machinery,\n      crowded very closely together, so that the eye can penetrate but a little\n      distance into the mass. Leaving this door open to its full extent, he goes\n      now round to the back of the box, and raising the drapery of the figure,\n      opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the one first opened.\n      Holding a lighted candle at this door, and shifting the position of the\n      whole machine repeatedly at the same time, a bright light is thrown\n      entirely through the cupboard, which is now clearly seen to be full,\n      completely full, of machinery. The spectators being satisfied of this\n      fact, Maelzel closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock,\n      lets fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front. The\n      door marked I, it will be remembered, is still open. The exhibiter now\n      proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the cupboards at the bottom\n      of the box—for although there are apparently two drawers, there is\n      really only one—the two handles and two key holes being intended\n      merely for ornament. Having opened this drawer to its full extent, a small\n      cushion, and a set of chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them\n      perpendicularly, are discovered. Leaving this drawer, as well as cupboard\n      No. 1 open, Maelzel now unlocks door No. 2, and door No. 3, which are\n      discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and the same compartment.\n      To the right of this compartment, however, (that is to say the spectators’\n      right) a small division, six inches wide, and filled with machinery, is\n      partitioned off. The main compartment itself (in speaking of that portion\n      of the box visible upon opening doors 2 and 3, we shall always call it the\n      main compartment) is lined with dark cloth and contains no machinery\n      whatever beyond two pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped, and situated one in\n      each of the rear top corners of the compartment. A small protuberance\n      about eight inches square, and also covered with dark cloth, lies on the\n      floor of the compartment near the rear corner on the spectators’ left\n      hand. Leaving doors No. 2 and No. 3 open as well as the drawer, and door\n      No. I, the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main compartment,\n      and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly all the interior of\n      the main compartment, by introducing a candle behind it and within it. The\n      whole box being thus apparently disclosed to the scrutiny of the company,\n      Maelzel, still leaving the doors and drawer open, rolls the Automaton\n      entirely round, and exposes the back of the Turk by lifting up the\n      drapery. A door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the\n      figure, and a smaller one also in the left thigh. The interior of the\n      figure, as seen through these apertures, appears to be crowded with\n      machinery. In general, every spectator is now thoroughly satisfied of\n      having beheld and completely scrutinized, at one and the same time, every\n      individual portion of the Automaton, and the idea of any person being\n      concealed in the interior, during so complete an exhibition of that\n      interior, if ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in\n      the extreme.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      M. Maelzel, having rolled the machine back into its original position, now\n      informs the company that the Automaton will play a game of chess with any\n      one disposed to encounter him. This challenge being accepted, a small\n      table is prepared for the antagonist, and placed close by the rope, but on\n      the spectators’ side of it, and so situated as not to prevent the company\n      from obtaining a full view of the Automaton. From a drawer in this table\n      is taken a set of chess-men, and Maelzel arranges them generally, but not\n      always, with his own hands, on the chess board, which consists merely of\n      the usual number of squares painted upon the table. The antagonist having\n      taken his seat, the exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box, and takes\n      therefrom the cushion, which, after removing the pipe from the hand of the\n      Automaton, he places under its left arm as a support. Then taking also\n      from the drawer the Automaton’s set of chess-men, he arranges them upon\n      the chessboard before the figure. He now proceeds to close the doors and\n      to lock them—leaving the bunch of keys in door No. 1. He also closes\n      the drawer, and, finally, winds up the machine, by applying a key to an\n      aperture in the left end (the spectators’ left) of the box. The game now\n      commences—the Automaton taking the first move. The duration of the\n      contest is usually limited to half an hour, but if it be not finished at\n      the expiration of this period, and the antagonist still contend that he\n      can beat the Automaton, M. Maelzel has seldom any objection to continue\n      it. Not to weary the company, is the ostensible, and no doubt the real\n      object of the limitation. It Wits of course be understood that when a move\n      is made at his own table, by the antagonist, the corresponding move is\n      made at the box of the Automaton, by Maelzel himself, who then acts as the\n      representative of the antagonist. On the other hand, when the Turk moves,\n      the corresponding move is made at the table of the antagonist, also by M.\n      Maelzel, who then acts as the representative of the Automaton. In this\n      manner it is necessary that the exhibiter should often pass from one table\n      to the other. He also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the\n      chess-men which it has taken, and which it deposits, when taken, on the\n      box to the left (to its own left) of the board. When the Automaton\n      hesitates in relation to its move, the exhibiter is occasionally seen to\n      place himself very near its right side, and to lay his hand, now and then,\n      in a careless manner upon the box. He has also a peculiar shuffle with his\n      feet, calculated to induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in\n      minds which are more cunning than sagacious. These peculiarities are, no\n      doubt, mere mannerisms of M. Maelzel, or, if he is aware of them at all,\n      he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the spectators a false\n      idea of the pure mechanism in the Automaton.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The Turk plays with his left hand. All the movements of the arm are at\n      right angles. In this manner, the hand (which is gloved and bent in a\n      natural way,) being brought directly above the piece to be moved, descends\n      finally upon it, the fingers receiving it, in most cases, without\n      difficulty. Occasionally, however, when the piece is not precisely in its\n      proper situation, the Automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it. When\n      this occurs, no second effort is made, but the arm continues its movement\n      in the direction originally intended, precisely as if the piece were in\n      the fingers. Having thus designated the spot whither the move should have\n      been made, the arm returns to its cushion, and Maelzel performs the\n      evolution which the Automaton pointed out. At every movement of the figure\n      machinery is heard in motion. During the progress of the game, the figure\n      now and then rolls its eyes, as if surveying the board, moves its head,\n      and pronounces the word <i>echec </i>(check) when necessary. {*3} If a\n      false move be made by his antagonist, he raps briskly on the box with the\n      fingers of his right hand, shakes his head roughly, and replacing the\n      piece falsely moved, in its former situation, assumes the next move\n      himself. Upon beating the game, he waves his head with an air of triumph,\n      looks round complacently upon the spectators, and drawing his left arm\n      farther back than usual, suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the\n      cushion. In general, the Turk is victorious—once or twice he has\n      been beaten. The game being ended, Maelzel will again if desired, exhibit\n      the mechanism of the box, in the same manner as before. The machine is\n      then rolled back, and a curtain hides it from the view of the company.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the Automaton. The\n      most general opinion in relation to it, an opinion too not unfrequently\n      adopted by men who should have known better, was, as we have before said,\n      that no immediate human agency was employed—in other words, that the\n      machine was purely a machine and nothing else. Many, however maintained\n      that the exhibiter himself regulated the movements of the figure by\n      mechanical means operating through the feet of the box. Others again,\n      spoke confidently of a magnet. Of the first of these opinions we shall say\n      nothing at present more than we have already said. In relation to the\n      second it is only necessary to repeat what we have before stated, that the\n      machine is rolled about on castors, and will, at the request of a\n      spectator, be moved to and fro to any portion of the room, even during the\n      progress of a game. The supposition of the magnet is also untenable—for\n      if a magnet were the agent, any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator\n      would disarrange the entire mechanism. The exhibiter, however, will suffer\n      the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box during the whole\n      of the exhibition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The first attempt at a written explanation of the secret, at least the\n      first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge, was made in a\n      large pamphlet printed at Paris in 1785. The author’s hypothesis amounted\n      to this—that a dwarf actuated the machine. This dwarf he supposed to\n      conceal himself during the opening of the box by thrusting his legs into\n      two hollow cylinders, which were represented to be (but which are not)\n      among the machinery in the cupboard No. I, while his body was out of the\n      box entirely, and covered by the drapery of the Turk. When the doors were\n      shut, the dwarf was enabled to bring his body within the box—the\n      noise produced by some portion of the machinery allowing him to do so\n      unheard, and also to close the door by which he entered. The interior of\n      the automaton being then exhibited, and no person discovered, the\n      spectators, says the author of this pamphlet, are satisfied that no one is\n      within any portion of the machine. This whole hypothesis was too obviously\n      absurd to require comment, or refutation, and accordingly we find that it\n      attracted very little attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In 1789 a book was published at Dresden by M. I. F. Freyhere in which\n      another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery. Mr. Freyhere’s book was\n      a pretty large one, and copiously illustrated by colored engravings. His\n      supposition was that “a well-taught boy very thin and tall of his age\n      (sufficiently so that he could be concealed in a drawer almost immediately\n      under the chess-board”) played the game of chess and effected all the\n      evolutions of the Automaton. This idea, although even more silly than that\n      of the Parisian author, met with a better reception, and was in some\n      measure believed to be the true solution of the wonder, until the inventor\n      put an end to the discussion by suffering a close examination of the top\n      of the box.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others equally\n      bizarre. Of late years however, an anonymous writer, by a course of\n      reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical, has contrived to blunder upon a\n      plausible solution—although we cannot consider it altogether the\n      true one. His Essay was first published in a Baltimore weekly paper, was\n      illustrated by cuts, and was entitled “An attempt to analyze the Automaton\n      Chess-Player of M. Maelzel.” This Essay we suppose to have been the\n      original of the <i>pamphlet to </i>which Sir David Brewster alludes in his\n      letters on Natural Magic, and which he has no hesitation in declaring a\n      thorough and satisfactory explanation. The <i>results </i>of the analysis\n      are undoubtedly, in the main, just; but we can only account for Brewster’s\n      pronouncing the Essay a thorough and satisfactory explanation, by\n      supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very cursory and inattentive\n      perusal. In the compendium of the Essay, made use of in the Letters on\n      Natural Magic, it is quite impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion\n      in regard to the adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis, on account of the\n      gross misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference employed.\n      The same fault is to be found in the “Attempt &amp;c.,” as we originally\n      saw it. The solution consists in a series of minute explanations,\n      (accompanied by wood-cuts, the whole occupying many pages) in which the\n      object is to show the <i>possibility </i>of <i>so shifting the partitions\n      </i>of the box, as to allow a human being, concealed in the interior, to\n      move portions of his body from one part of the box to another, during the\n      exhibition of the mechanism—thus eluding the scrutiny of the\n      spectators. There can be no doubt, as we have before observed, and as we\n      will presently endeavor to show, that the principle, or rather the result,\n      of this solution is the true one. Some person is concealed in the box\n      during the whole time of exhibiting the interior. We object, however, to\n      the whole verbose description of the <i>manner </i>in which the partitions\n      are shifted, to accommodate the movements of the person concealed. We\n      object to it as a mere theory assumed in the first place, and to which\n      circumstances are afterwards made to adapt themselves. It was not, and\n      could not have been, arrived at by any inductive reasoning. In whatever\n      way the shifting is managed, it is of course concealed at every step from\n      observation. To show that certain movements might possibly be effected in\n      a certain way, is very far from showing that they are actually so\n      effected. There may be an infinity of other methods by which the same\n      results may be obtained. The probability of the one assumed proving the\n      correct one is then as unity to infinity. But, in reality, this particular\n      point, the shifting of the partitions, is of no consequence whatever. It\n      was altogether unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose\n      of proving what no one in his senses would deny—viz: that the\n      wonderful mechanical genius of Baron Kempelen could invent the necessary\n      means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel, with a human agent\n      too at his service in actual contact with the pannel or the door, and the\n      whole operations carried on, as the author of the Essay himself shows, and\n      as we shall attempt to show more fully hereafter, entirely out of reach of\n      the observation of the spectators.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton, we will, in the\n      first place, endeavor to show how its operations are effected, and\n      afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the nature of the <i>observations\n      </i>from which we have deduced our result.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject, that we\n      repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the exhibiter in\n      disclosing the interior of the box—a routine from which he <i>never\n      </i>deviates in any material particular. In the first place he opens the\n      door No. I. Leaving this open, he goes round to the rear of the box, and\n      opens a door precisely at the back of door No. I. To this back door he\n      holds a lighted candle. He then <i>closes the back door, </i>locks it,\n      and, coming round to the front, opens the drawer to its full extent. This\n      done, he opens the doors No. 2 and No. 3, (the folding doors) and displays\n      the interior of the main compartment. Leaving open the main compartment,\n      the drawer, and the front door of cupboard No. I, he now goes to the rear\n      again, and throws open the back door of the main compartment. In shutting\n      up the box no particular order is observed, except that the folding doors\n      are always closed before the drawer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now, let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into the\n      presence of the spectators, a man is already within it. His body is\n      situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No. T. (the rear portion\n      of which machinery is so contrived as to slip <i>en masse, </i>from the\n      main compartment to the cupboard No. I, as occasion may require,) and his\n      legs lie at full length in the main compartment. When Maelzel opens the\n      door No. I, the man within is not in any danger of discovery, for the\n      keenest eye cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness\n      within. But the case is otherwise when the back door of the cupboard No.\n      I, is opened. A bright light then pervades the cupboard, and the body of\n      the man would be discovered if it were there. But it is not. The putting\n      the key in the lock of the back door was a signal on hearing which the\n      person concealed brought his body forward to an angle as acute as possible—throwing\n      it altogether, or nearly so, into the main compartment. This, however, is\n      a painful position, and cannot be long maintained. Accordingly we find\n      that Maelzel <i>closes the back door. </i>This being done, there is no\n      reason why the body of the man may not resume its former situation—for\n      the cupboard is again so dark as to defy scrutiny. The drawer is now\n      opened, and the legs of the person within drop down behind it in the space\n      it formerly occupied. {*4} There is, consequently, now no longer any part\n      of the man in the main compartment—his body being behind the\n      machinery in cupboard No. 1, and his legs in the space occupied by the\n      drawer. The exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty to display the\n      main compartment. This he does—opening both its back and front doors—and\n      no person Is discovered. The spectators are now satisfied that the whole\n      of the box is exposed to view—and exposed too, all portions of it at\n      one and the same time. But of course this is not the case. They neither\n      see the space behind the drawer, nor the interior of cupboard No. 1—the\n      front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in shutting its\n      back door. Maelzel, having now rolled the machine around, lifted up the\n      drapery of the Turk, opened the doors in his back and thigh, and shown his\n      trunk to be full of machinery, brings the whole back into its original\n      position, and closes the doors. The man within is now at liberty to move\n      about. He gets up into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring his\n      eyes above the level of the chess-board. It is very probable that he seats\n      himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is seen in a\n      corner of the main compartment when the doors are open. In this position\n      he sees the chess-board through the bosom of the Turk which is of gauze.\n      Bringing his right arm across his breast he actuates the little machinery\n      necessary to guide the left arm and the fingers of the figure. This\n      machinery is situated just beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is\n      consequently easily reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we\n      suppose his right arm brought across the breast. The motions of the head\n      and eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound <i>echec\n      </i>are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and actuated at will\n      by the man within. The whole of this mechanism—that is to say all\n      the mechanism essential to the machine—is most probably contained\n      within the little cupboard (of about six inches in breadth) partitioned\n      off at the right (the spectators’ right) of the main compartment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In this analysis of the operations of the Automaton, we have purposely\n      avoided any allusion to the manner in which the partitions are shifted,\n      and it will now be readily comprehended that this point is a matter of no\n      importance, since, by mechanism within the ability of any common\n      carpenter, it might be effected in an infinity of different ways, and\n      since we have shown that, however performed, it is performed out of the\n      view of the spectators. Our result is founded upon the following <i>observations\n      </i>taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of Maelzel. {*5}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I. The moves of the Turk are not made at regular intervals of time, but\n      accommodate themselves to the moves of the antagonist—although this\n      point (of regularity) so important in all kinds of mechanical contrivance,\n      might have been readily brought about by limiting the time allowed for the\n      moves of the antagonist. For example, if this limit were three minutes,\n      the moves of the Automaton might be made at any given intervals longer\n      than three minutes. The fact then of irregularity, when regularity might\n      have been so easily attained, goes to prove that regularity is unimportant\n      to the action of the Automaton—in other words, that the Automaton is\n      not a <i>pure machine.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      2. When the Automaton is about to move a piece, a distinct motion is\n      observable just beneath the left shoulder, and which motion agitates in a\n      slight degree, the drapery covering the front of the left shoulder. This\n      motion invariably precedes, by about two seconds, the movement of the arm\n      itself—and the arm never, in any instance, moves without this\n      preparatory motion in the shoulder. Now let the antagonist move a piece,\n      and let the corresponding move be made by Maelzel, as usual, upon the\n      board of the Automaton. Then let the antagonist narrowly watch the\n      Automaton, until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder.\n      Immediately upon detecting this motion, and before the arm itself begins\n      to move, let him withdraw his piece, as if perceiving an error in his\n      manœuvre. It will then be seen that the movement of the arm, which, in\n      all other cases, immediately succeeds the motion in the shoulder, is\n      withheld—is not made—although Maelzel has not yet performed,\n      on the board of the Automaton, any move corresponding to the withdrawal of\n      the antagonist. In this case, that the Automaton was about to move is\n      evident—and that he did not move, was an effect plainly produced by\n      the withdrawal of the antagonist, and without any intervention of Maelzel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This fact fully proves, 1—that the intervention of Maelzel, in\n      performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the Automaton, is\n      not essential to the movements of the Automaton, 2—that its\n      movements are regulated by <i>mind—</i>by some person who sees the\n      board of the antagonist, 3—that its movements are not regulated by\n      the mind of Maelzel, whose back was turned towards the antagonist at the\n      withdrawal of his move.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      3. The Automaton does not invariably win the game. Were the machine a pure\n      machine this would not be the case—it would always win. The <i>principle\n      </i>being discovered by which a machine can be made to <i>play </i>a game\n      of chess, an extension of the same principle would enable it to win a game—a\n      farther extension would enable it to win <i>all </i>games—that is,\n      to beat any possible game of an antagonist. A little consideration will\n      convince any one that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games,\n      Is not in the least degree greater, as regards the principle of the\n      operations necessary, than that of making it beat a single game. If then\n      we regard the Chess-Player as a machine, we must suppose, (what is highly\n      improbable,) that its inventor preferred leaving it incomplete to\n      perfecting it—a supposition rendered still more absurd, when we\n      reflect that the leaving it incomplete would afford an argument against\n      the possibility of its being a pure machine—the very argument we now\n      adduce.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      4. When the situation of the game is difficult or complex, we never\n      perceive the Turk either shake his head or roll his eyes. It is only when\n      his next move is obvious, or when the game is so circumstanced that to a\n      man in the Automaton’s place there would be no necessity for reflection.\n      Now these peculiar movements of the head and eyes are movements customary\n      with persons engaged in meditation, and the ingenious Baron Kempelen would\n      have adapted these movements (were the machine a pure machine) to\n      occasions proper for their display—that is, to occasions of\n      complexity. But the reverse is seen to be the case, and this reverse\n      applies precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior. When\n      engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of setting in\n      motion the mechanism of the Automaton by which are moved the head and the\n      eyes. When the game, however, is obvious, he has time to look about him,\n      and, accordingly, we see the head shake and the eyes roll.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      5. When the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an examination\n      of the back of the Turk, and when his drapery is lifted up and the doors\n      in the trunk and thigh thrown open, the interior of the trunk is seen to\n      be crowded with machinery. In scrutinizing this machinery while the\n      Automaton was in motion, that is to say while the whole machine was moving\n      on the castors, it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism\n      changed their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted for\n      by the simple laws of perspective; and subsequent examinations convinced\n      us that these undue alterations were attributable to mirrors in the\n      interior of the trunk. The introduction of mirrors among the machinery\n      could not have been intended to influence, in any degree, the machinery\n      itself. Their operation, whatever that operation should prove to be, must\n      necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator. We at once\n      concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to the vision some\n      few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to give it the appearance\n      of being crowded with mechanism. Now the direct inference from this is\n      that the machine is not a pure machine. For if it were, the inventor, so\n      far from wishing its mechanism to appear complex, and using deception for\n      the purpose of giving it this appearance, would have been especially\n      desirous of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition, of the <i>simplicity\n      </i>of the means by which results so wonderful were brought about.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      6. The external appearance, and, especially, the deportment of the Turk,\n      are, when we consider them as imitations of <i>life, </i>but very\n      indifferent imitations. The countenance evinces no ingenuity, and is\n      surpassed, in its resemblance to the human face, by the very commonest of\n      wax-works. The eyes roll unnaturally in the head, without any\n      corresponding motions of the lids or brows. The arm, particularly,\n      performs its operations in an exceedingly stiff, awkward, jerking, and\n      rectangular manner. Now, all this is the result either of inability in\n      Maelzel to do better, or of intentional neglect—accidental neglect\n      being out of the question, when we consider that the whole time of the\n      ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his machines. Most\n      assuredly we must not refer the unlife-like appearances to inability—for\n      all the rest of Maelzel’s automata are evidence of his full ability to\n      copy the motions and peculiarities of life with the most wonderful\n      exactitude. The rope-dancers, for example, are inimitable. When the clown\n      laughs, his lips, his eyes, his eye-brows, and eyelids—indeed, all\n      the features of his countenance—are imbued with their appropriate\n      expressions. In both him and his companion, every gesture is so entirely\n      easy, and free from the semblance of artificiality, that, were it not for\n      the diminutiveness of their size, and the fact of their being passed from\n      one spectator to another previous to their exhibition on the rope, it\n      would be difficult to convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden\n      automata were not living creatures. We cannot, therefore, doubt Mr.\n      Maelzel’s ability, and we must necessarily suppose that he intentionally\n      suffered his Chess Player to remain the same artificial and unnatural\n      figure which Baron Kempelen (no doubt also through design) originally made\n      it. What this design was it is not difficult to conceive. Were the\n      Automaton life-like in its motions, the spectator would be more apt to\n      attribute its operations to their true cause, (that is, to human agency\n      within) than he is now, when the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey\n      the idea of pure and unaided mechanism.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      7. When, a short time previous to the commencement of the game, the\n      Automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual, an ear in any degree\n      accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a system of machinery,\n      will not fail to discover, instantaneously, that the axis turned by the\n      key in the box of the Chess-Player, cannot possibly be connected with\n      either a weight, a spring, or any system of machinery whatever. The\n      inference here is the same as in our last observation. The winding up is\n      inessential to the operations of the Automaton, and is performed with the\n      design of exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      8. When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel—“Is the\n      Automaton a pure machine or not?” his reply is invariably the same—“I\n      will say nothing about it.” Now the notoriety of the Automaton, and the\n      great curiosity it has every where excited, are owing more especially to\n      the prevalent opinion that it is a pure machine, than to any other\n      circumstance. Of course, then, it is the interest of the proprietor to\n      represent it as a pure machine. And what more obvious, and more effectual\n      method could there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea,\n      than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect? On the other\n      hand, what more obvious and effectual method could there be of exciting a\n      disbelief in the Automaton’s being a pure machine, than by withholding\n      such explicit declaration? For, people will naturally reason thus,—It\n      is Maelzel’s interest to represent this thing a pure machine—he\n      refuses to do so, directly, in words, although he does not scruple, and is\n      evidently anxious to do so, indirectly by actions—were it actually\n      what he wishes to represent it by actions, he would gladly avail himself\n      of the more direct testimony of words—the inference is, that a\n      consciousness of its not being a pure machine, is the reason of his\n      silence—his actions cannot implicate him in a falsehood—his\n      words may.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      9. When, in exhibiting the interior of the box, Maelzel has thrown open\n      the door No. I, and also the door immediately behind it, he holds a\n      lighted candle at the back door (as mentioned above) and moves the entire\n      machine to and fro with a view of convincing the company that the cupboard\n      No. 1 is entirely filled with machinery. When the machine is thus moved\n      about, it will be apparent to any careful observer, that whereas that\n      portion of the machinery near the front door No. 1, is perfectly steady\n      and unwavering, the portion farther within fluctuates, in a very slight\n      degree, with the movements of the machine. This circumstance first aroused\n      in us the suspicion that the more remote portion of the machinery was so\n      arranged as to be easily slipped, <i>en masse, </i>from its position when\n      occasion should require it. This occasion we have already stated to occur\n      when the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position upon\n      the closing of the back door.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      10. Sir David Brewster states the figure of the Turk to be of the size of\n      life—but in fact it is far above the ordinary size. Nothing is more\n      easy than to err in our notions of magnitude. The body of the Automaton is\n      generally insulated, and, having no means of immediately comparing it with\n      any human form, we suffer ourselves to consider it as of ordinary\n      dimensions. This mistake may, however, be corrected by observing the\n      Chess-Player when, as is sometimes the case, the exhibiter approaches it.\n      Mr. Maelzel, to be sure, is not very tall, but upon drawing near the\n      machine, his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of\n      the Turk, although the latter, it will be remembered, is in a sitting\n      position.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      11. The box behind which the Automaton is placed, is precisely three feet\n      six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two feet six inches high.\n      These dimensions are fully sufficient for the accommodation of a man very\n      much above the common size—and the main compartment alone is capable\n      of holding any ordinary man in the position we have mentioned as assumed\n      by the person concealed. As these are facts, which any one who doubts them\n      may prove by actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon\n      them. We will only suggest that, although the top of the box is apparently\n      a board of about three inches in thickness, the spectator may satisfy\n      himself by stooping and looking up at it when the main compartment is\n      open, that it is in reality very thin. The height of the drawer also will\n      be misconceived by those who examine it in a cursory manner. There is a\n      space of about three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the\n      exterior, and the bottom of the cupboard—a space which must be\n      included in the height of the drawer. These contrivances to make the room\n      within the box appear less than it actually is, are referrible to a design\n      on the part of the inventor, to impress the company again with a false\n      idea, viz. that no human being can be accommodated within the box.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      12. The interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with <i>cloth.\n      </i>This cloth we suppose to have a twofold object. A portion of <i>it\n      </i>may form, when tightly stretched, the only partitions which there is\n      any necessity for removing during the changes of the man’s position, viz:\n      the partition between the rear of the main compartment and the rear of the\n      cupboard No. 1, and the partition between the main compartment, and the\n      space behind the drawer when open. If we imagine this to be the case, the\n      difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once, if indeed any such\n      difficulty could be supposed under any circumstances to exist. The second\n      object of the cloth is to deaden and render indistinct all sounds\n      occasioned by the movements of the person within.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      13. The antagonist (as we have before observed) is not suffered to play at\n      the board of the Automaton, but is seated at some distance from the\n      machine. The reason which, most probably, would be assigned for this\n      circumstance, if the question were demanded, is, that were the antagonist\n      otherwise situated, his person would intervene between the machine and the\n      spectators, and preclude the latter from a distinct view. But this\n      difficulty might be easily obviated, either by elevating the seats of the\n      company, or by turning the end of the box towards them during the game.\n      The true cause of the restriction is, perhaps, very different. Were the\n      antagonist seated in contact with the box, the secret would be liable to\n      discovery, by his detecting, with the aid of a quick car, the breathings\n      of the man concealed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      14. Although M. Maelzel, in disclosing the interior of the machine,\n      sometimes slightly deviates from the <i>routine </i>which we have pointed\n      out, yet <i>reeler in </i>any instance does he <i>so </i>deviate from it\n      as to interfere with our solution. For example, he has been known to open,\n      first of all, the drawer—but he never opens the main compartment\n      without first closing the back door of cupboard No. 1—he never opens\n      the main compartment without first pulling out the drawer—he never\n      shuts the drawer without first shutting the main compartment—he\n      never opens the back door of cupboard No. 1 while the main compartment is\n      open—and the game of chess is never commenced until the whole\n      machine is closed. Now if it were observed that <i>never, in any single\n      instance, </i>did M. Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out\n      as necessary to our solution, it would be one of the strongest possible\n      arguments in corroboration of it—but the argument becomes infinitely\n      strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that he <i>does\n      occasionally </i>deviate from the routine but never does <i>so </i>deviate\n      as to falsify the solution.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      15. There are six candles on the board of the Automaton during exhibition.\n      The question naturally arises—“Why are so many employed, when a\n      single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have been amply sufficient to\n      afford the spectators a clear view of the board, in a room otherwise so\n      well lit up as the exhibition room always is—when, moreover, if we\n      suppose the machine a <i>pure machine, </i>there can be no necessity for\n      so much light, or indeed any light at all, to enable <i>it </i>to perform\n      its operations—and when, especially, only a single candle is placed\n      upon the table of the antagonist?” The first and most obvious inference\n      is, that so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see\n      through the transparent material (probably fine gauze) of which the breast\n      of the Turk is composed. But when we consider the arrangement of the\n      candles, another reason immediately presents itself. There are six lights\n      (as we have said before) in all. Three of these are on each side of the\n      figure. Those most remote from the spectators are the longest—those\n      in the middle are about two inches shorter—and those nearest the\n      company about two inches shorter still—and the candles on one side\n      differ in height from the candles respectively opposite on the other, by a\n      ratio different from two inches—that is to say, the longest candle\n      on one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on the\n      other, and so on. Thus it will be seen that no two of the candles are of\n      the same height, and thus also the difficulty of ascertaining the <i>material\n      </i>of the breast of the figure (against which the light is especially\n      directed) is greatly augmented by the dazzling effect of the complicated\n      crossings of the rays—crossings which are brought about by placing\n      the centres of radiation all upon different levels.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      16. While the Chess-Player was in possession of Baron Kempelen, it was\n      more than once observed, first, that an Italian in the suite of the Baron\n      was never visible during the playing of a game at chess by the Turk, and,\n      secondly, that the Italian being taken seriously ill, the exhibition was\n      suspended until his recovery. This Italian professed a <i>total </i>ignorance\n      of the game of chess, although all others of the suite played well.\n      Similar observations have been made since the Automaton has been purchased\n      by Maelzel. There is a man, <i>Schlumberoer, </i>who attends him wherever\n      he goes, but who has no ostensible occupation other than that of assisting\n      in the packing and unpacking of the automata. This man is about the medium\n      size, and has a remarkable stoop in the shoulders. Whether he professes to\n      play chess or not, we are not informed. It is quite certain, however, that\n      he is never to be seen during the exhibition of the Chess-Player, although\n      frequently visible just before and just after the exhibition. Moreover,\n      some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond with his automata, and exhibited\n      them, we believe, in the house now occupied by M. Bossieux as a Dancing\n      Academy. <i>Schlumberg</i>er was suddenly taken ill, and during his\n      illness there was no exhibition of the Chess-Player. These facts are well\n      known to many of our citizens. The reason assigned for the suspension of\n      the Chess-Player’s performances, was <i>not </i>the illness of <i>Schlumberger.\n      </i>The inferences from all this we leave, without farther comment, to the\n      reader.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      17. The Turk plays with his <i>left</i> arm. A circumstance so remarkable\n      cannot be accidental. Brewster takes no notice of it whatever beyond a\n      mere statement, we believe, that such is the fact. The early writers of\n      treatises on the Automaton, seem not to have observed the matter at all,\n      and have no reference to it. The author of the pamphlet alluded to by\n      Brewster, mentions it, but acknowledges his inability to account for it.\n      Yet it is obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as\n      this that deductions are to be made (if made at all) which shall lead us\n      to the truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The circumstance of the Automaton’s playing with his left hand cannot have\n      connexion with the operations of the machine, considered merely as such.\n      Any mechanical arrangement which would cause the figure to move, in any\n      given manner, the left arm—could, if reversed, cause it to move, in\n      the same manner, the right. But these principles cannot be extended to the\n      human organization, wherein there is a marked and radical difference in\n      the construction, and, at all events, in the powers, of the right and left\n      arms. Reflecting upon this latter fact, we naturally refer the incongruity\n      noticeable in the Chess-Player to this peculiarity in the human\n      organization. If so, we must imagine some <i>reversion—</i>for the\n      Chess-Player plays precisely as a man <i>would not. </i>These ideas, once\n      entertained, are sufficient of themselves, to suggest the notion of a man\n      in the interior. A few more imperceptible steps lead us, finally, to the\n      result. The Automaton plays with his left arm, because under no other\n      circumstances could the man within play with his right—a <i>desideratum\n      </i>of course. Let us, for example, imagine the Automaton to play with his\n      right arm. To reach the machinery which moves the arm, and which we have\n      before explained to lie just beneath the shoulder, it would be necessary\n      for the man within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful\n      and awkward position, (viz. brought up close to his body and tightly\n      compressed between his body and the side of the Automaton,) or else to use\n      his left arm brought across his breast. In neither case could he act with\n      the requisite ease or precision. On the contrary, the Automaton playing,\n      as it actually does, with the left arm, all difficulties vanish. The right\n      arm of the man within is brought across his breast, and his right fingers\n      act, without any constraint, upon the machinery in the shoulder of the\n      figure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged against this\n      solution of the Automaton Chess-Player.\n    </p>\n",

Look down into the abysmal distances!—attempt to force the\n      gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly\n      through them thus—and thus—and thus! Even the spiritual\n      vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of\n      the universe?—the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that\n      mere number has appeared to blend into unity?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. There are <i>no</i> dreams in Aidenn—but it is here whispered\n      that, of this infinity of matter, the <i>sole</i> purpose is to afford infinite\n      springs, at which the soul may allay the thirst <i>to know</i>, which is for ever\n      unquenchable within it—since to quench it, would be to extinguish\n      the soul’s self.

And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!—speak to me in\n      the earth’s familiar tones. I understand not what you hinted to me, just\n      now, of the modes or of the method of what, during mortality, we were\n      accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is not\n      God?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. I mean to say that the Deity does not create.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. Explain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which\n      are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing into being, can\n      only be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or\n      immediate results of the Divine creative power.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in\n      the extreme.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. I can comprehend you thus far—that certain operations of what\n      we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give\n      rise to that which has all the <i>appearance</i> of creation. Shortly before the\n      final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very\n      successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to\n      denominate the creation of animalculæ.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the\n      secondary creation—and of the only species of creation which has\n      ever been, since the first word spoke into existence the first law.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst\n      hourly forth into the heavens—are not these stars, Agathos, the\n      immediate handiwork of the King?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the\n      conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can perish, so\n      no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for example, when\n      we were dwellers on the earth, and, in so doing, gave vibration to the\n      atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was indefinitely extended,\n      till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth’s air, which\n      thenceforward, and for ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand.\n      This fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew. They made the special\n      effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of\n      exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine in what\n      precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and\n      impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere circumambient.\n      Retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a given effect, under given\n      conditions, in determining the value of the original impulse. Now the\n      mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were\n      absolutely endless—and who saw that a portion of these results were\n      accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis—who\n      saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation—these men saw, at the\n      same time, that this species of analysis itself, had within itself a\n      capacity for indefinite progress—that there were no bounds\n      conceivable to its advancement and applicability, except within the\n      intellect of him who advanced or applied it. But at this point our\n      mathematicians paused.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond.\n      It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite\n      understanding—one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis\n      lay unfolded—there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse\n      given the air—and the ether through the air—to the remotest\n      consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed\n      demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must, in the end,\n      impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;—and\n      the being of infinite understanding—the being whom we have imagined—might\n      trace the remote undulations of the impulse—trace them upward and\n      onward in their influences upon all particles of an matter—upward\n      and onward for ever in their modifications of old forms—or, in other\n      words, in their creation of new—until he found them reflected—unimpressive\n      at last—back from the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such\n      a thing do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him—should\n      one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his\n      inspection—he could have no difficulty in determining, by the\n      analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This power\n      of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection—this\n      faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is of\n      course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every variety of\n      degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by\n      the whole host of the Angelic intelligences.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth; but the\n      general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether—which,\n      since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium\n      of creation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of\n      all motion is thought—and the source of all thought is—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. God.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of the fair Earth\n      which lately perished—of impulses upon the atmosphere of the Earth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. You did.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some\n      thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an impulse on\n      the air?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      OINOS. But why, Agathos, do you weep—and why, oh why do your wings\n      droop as we hover above this fair star—which is the greenest and yet\n      most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant\n      flowers look like a fairy dream—but its fierce volcanoes like the\n      passions of a turbulent heart.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      AGATHOS. They are!—they are! This wild star—it is now three\n      centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet\n      of my beloved—I spoke it—with a few passionate sentences—into\n      birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams,\n      and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and\n      unhallowed of hearts.\n    </p>\n",

I observe, too,\n      a vacillation in your step—a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are\n      confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal. Yes,\n      it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word which of\n      old was wont to bring terror to all hearts—throwing a mildew upon\n      all pleasures!\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Una.</i> Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often,\n      Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How\n      mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss—saying unto it\n      “thus far, and no farther!” That earnest mutual love, my own\n      Monos, which burned within our bosoms—how vainly did we flatter\n      ourselves, feeling happy in its first up-springing, that our happiness\n      would strengthen with its strength! Alas! as it grew, so grew in our\n      hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us\n      forever! Thus, in time, it became painful to love. Hate would have been\n      mercy then.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Monos.</i> Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una—mine, mine,\n      forever now!\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i> Una.</i> But the memory of past sorrow—is it not present joy? I\n      have much to say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to\n      know the incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i> Monos.</i> And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in\n      vain? I will be minute in relating all—but at what point shall the\n      weird narrative begin?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Una.</i> At what point?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Monos.</i> You have said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Una.</i> Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the\n      propensity of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then,\n      commence with the moment of life’s cessation—but commence with that\n      sad, sad instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a\n      breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid eyelids\n      with the passionate fingers of love.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i> Monos.</i> One word first, my Una, in regard to man’s general\n      condition at this epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise\n      among our forefathers—wise in fact, although not in the world’s\n      esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term\n      “improvement,” as applied to the progress of our civilization. There were\n      periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our\n      dissolution, when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for\n      those principles whose truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason,\n      so utterly obvious—principles which should have taught our race to\n      submit to the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their\n      control. At long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking upon each\n      advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in the true utility.\n      Occasionally the poetic intellect—that intellect which we now feel\n      to have been the most exalted of all—since those truths which to us\n      were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy\n      which speaks in proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided\n      reason bears no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect\n      proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the\n      philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of\n      knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct\n      intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of\n      his soul. And these men—the poets—living and perishing amid\n      the scorn of the “utilitarians”—of rough pedants, who arrogated to\n      themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the\n      scorned—these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,\n      upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our\n      enjoyments were keen—days when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly\n      deep-toned was happiness—holy, august and blissful days, when blue\n      rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes,\n      primæval, odorous, and unexplored.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to\n      strengthen it by opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of\n      all our evil days. The great “movement”—that was the\n      cant term—went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical.\n      Art—the Arts—arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains\n      upon the intellect which had elevated them to power. Man, because he\n      could not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish\n      exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion over her\n      elements. Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy, an infantine\n      imbecility came over him. As might be supposed from the origin of his\n      disorder, he grew infected with system, and with abstraction. He\n      enwrapped himself in generalities. Among other odd ideas, that of\n      universal equality gained ground; and in the face of analogy and of\n      God—in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of\n      <i>gradation</i> so visibly pervading all things in Earth and\n      Heaven—wild attempts at an omni-prevalent Democracy were made. Yet\n      this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil—Knowledge. Man\n      could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking cities arose,\n      innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces. The\n      fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome\n      disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced\n      and of the far-fetched might have arrested us here. But now it appears\n      that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our\n      taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools. For,\n      in truth, it was at this crisis that taste alone—that faculty\n      which, holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral\n      sense, could never safely have been disregarded—it was now that\n      taste alone could have led us gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to\n      Life. But alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition\n      of Plato! Alas for the μουσικη which\n      he justly regarded as an all-sufficient education for the soul! Alas for\n      him and for it!—since both were most desperately needed when both\n      were most entirely forgotten or despised. {*1}\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how truly!—“que\n      tout notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au sentiment;” and it is not\n      impossible that the sentiment of the natural, had time permitted it, would\n      have regained its old ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the\n      schools. But this thing was not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance\n      of knowledge the old age of the world drew on. This the mass of mankind\n      saw not, or, living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But,\n      for myself, the Earth’s records had taught me to look for widest ruin as\n      the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our Fate\n      from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria the\n      architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than either,\n      the turbulent mother of all Arts. In history {*2} of these regions I met\n      with a ray from the Future. The individual artificialities of the three\n      latter were local diseases of the Earth, and in their individual\n      overthrows we had seen local remedies applied; but for the infected world\n      at large I could anticipate no regeneration save in death. That man, as a\n      race, should not become extinct, I saw that he must be “born again.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits, daily,\n      in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the days to\n      come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having undergone that\n      purification {*3} which alone could efface its rectangular obscenities,\n      should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the mountain-slopes and the\n      smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place\n      for man:—for man the Death purged—for man to whose now exalted\n      intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more—for the\n      redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal, but still for the\n      material, man.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Una.</i> Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the\n      epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and\n      as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men\n      lived; and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the\n      grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though the\n      century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings us thus\n      together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of\n      duration, yet, my Monos, it was a century still.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Monos.</i> Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably,\n      it was in the Earth’s dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties\n      which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to\n      the fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium\n      replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain,\n      while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you—after some days\n      there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless torpor;\n      and this was termed Death by those who stood around me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience. It\n      appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him,\n      who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and fully\n      prostrate in a midsummer noon, begins to steal slowly back into\n      consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without\n      being awakened by external disturbances.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to beat.\n      Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were unusually\n      active, although eccentrically so—assuming often each other’s\n      functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably confounded,\n      and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The rose-water with which\n      your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last, affected me with sweet\n      fancies of flowers—fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of\n      the old Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. The\n      eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete impediment to\n      vision. As volition was in abeyance, the balls could not roll in their\n      sockets but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were\n      seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external\n      retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than\n      those which struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former\n      instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as\n      sound—sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves\n      at my side were light or dark in shade—curved or angular in outline.\n      The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree, was not\n      irregular in action—estimating real sounds with an extravagance of\n      precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a\n      modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily received, but\n      pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest physical\n      pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at\n      first only recognised through vision, at length, long after their removal,\n      filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable. I say with a\n      sensual delight. All my perceptions were purely sensual. The materials\n      furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree\n      wrought into shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there was some\n      little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at\n      all. Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful\n      cadences, and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but\n      they were soft musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct\n      reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while the large\n      and constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a\n      heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone.\n      And this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke\n      reverently, in low whispers—you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud\n      cries.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark figures which\n      flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my vision\n      they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side their images\n      impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and other dismal\n      expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo. You alone, habited in a white\n      robe, passed in all directions musically about me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a vague\n      uneasiness—an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds\n      fall continuously within his ear—low distant bell-tones, solemn, at\n      long but equal intervals, and mingling with melancholy dreams. Night\n      arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It oppressed my limbs\n      with the oppression of some dull weight, and was palpable. There was also\n      a moaning sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more\n      continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown in\n      strength with the darkness. Suddenly lights were brought into the room,\n      and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal\n      bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous\n      oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of\n      each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a\n      strain of melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed\n      upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor\n      from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose\n      tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical\n      sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to\n      sentiment itself—a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded\n      to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the\n      pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and\n      faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely\n      sensual pleasure as before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there appeared\n      to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its exercise I found a\n      wild delight—yet a delight still physical, inasmuch as the\n      understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal frame had fully\n      ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery throbbed. But\n      there seemed to have sprung up in the brain, that of which no words could\n      convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct conception. Let\n      me term it a mental pendulous pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of\n      man’s abstract idea of Time. By the absolute equalization of this movement—or\n      of such as this—had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves,\n      been adjusted. By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon\n      the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came\n      sonorously to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion—and\n      these deviations were omni-prevalent—affected me just as violations\n      of abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect the moral sense. Although\n      no two of the time-pieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds\n      accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind\n      the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And this—this\n      keen, perfect, self-existing sentiment of duration—this sentiment\n      existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist)\n      independently of any succession of events—this idea—this sixth\n      sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and\n      certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal\n      Eternity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed\n      from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The lamps\n      burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the\n      monotonous strains. But, suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness\n      and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my nostrils died away.\n      Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression of the Darkness\n      uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shock like that of electricity\n      pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact.\n      All of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of\n      entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. The mortal body had\n      been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly Decay.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the\n      sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic\n      intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the\n      flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of\n      one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you sat by\n      my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was not\n      unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side, which\n      confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which\n      bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped heavily the\n      mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my\n      sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there\n      rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly each\n      second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its flight—without\n      effort and without object.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A year passed. The consciousness of being had grown hourly more\n      indistinct, and that of mere locality had, in great measure, usurped its\n      position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place. The\n      narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body, was now\n      growing to be the body itself. At length, as often happens to the sleeper\n      (by sleep and its world alone is Death imaged)—at length, as\n      sometimes happened on Earth to the deep slumberer, when some flitting\n      light half startled him into awaking, yet left him half enveloped in\n      dreams—so to me, in the strict embrace of the Shadow came that light\n      which alone might have had power to startle—the light of enduring\n      Love. Men toiled at the grave in which I lay darkling. They upthrew the\n      damp earth. Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of Una.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now again all was void. That nebulous light had been extinguished.\n      That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence. Many lustra had\n      supervened. Dust had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The\n      sense of being had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its\n      stead—instead of all things—dominant and perpetual—the\n      autocrats Place and Time. For that which was not—for that which had\n      no form—for that which had no thought—for that which had no\n      sentience—for that which was soulless, yet of which matter formed no\n      portion—for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the\n      grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.\n    </p>\n",

To-morrow we will speak of this. Your\n      mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple\n      memories. Look not around, nor forward—but back. I am burning with\n      anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among\n      us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar things, in the old familiar\n      language of the world which has so fearfully perished.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"drama\">\n      EIROS.<br>\n      Most fearfully, fearfully!—this is indeed no dream.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"drama\">\n      CHARMION.<br>\n      Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?\n    </p>\n<p class=\"drama\">\n      EIROS.<br>\n      Mourned, Charmion?—oh deeply. To that last hour of all, there hung a\n      cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"drama\">\n      CHARMION.<br>\n      And that last hour—speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact\n      of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among\n      mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave—at that period, if I\n      remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly\n      unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative philosophy of\n      the day.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"drama\">\n      EIROS.<br>\n      The individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated; but\n      analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with\n      astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you left\n      us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings\n      which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire, as having\n      reference to the orb of the earth alone. But in regard to the immediate\n      agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in\n      astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of\n      flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well\n      established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites of\n      Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the\n      masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had long regarded\n      the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as\n      altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the\n      event of contact. But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the\n      elements of all the comets were accurately known. That among them we\n      should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been\n      for many years considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild\n      fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind; and,\n      although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension\n      prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this\n      announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and\n      mistrust.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it was at\n      once conceded by all observers, that its path, at perihelion, would bring\n      it into very close proximity with the earth. There were two or three\n      astronomers, of secondary note, who resolutely maintained that a contact\n      was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the effect of this\n      intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they would not believe\n      an assertion which their intellect so long employed among worldly\n      considerations could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a vitally\n      important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most\n      stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lied not, and\n      they awaited the comet. Its approach was not, at first, seemingly rapid;\n      nor was its appearance of very unusual character. It was of a dull red,\n      and had little perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no\n      material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration\n      in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded and all\n      interests absorbed in a growing discussion, instituted by the philosophic,\n      in respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused their\n      sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned now gave their\n      intellect—their soul—to no such points as the allaying of\n      fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought—they panted\n      for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. Truth arose in the\n      purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed down and\n      adored.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from\n      the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the\n      wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the\n      fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated, that the density of the comet’s\n      nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage\n      of a similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly\n      insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror. Theologists with\n      an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and\n      expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no\n      previous instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth\n      must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that\n      enforced every where conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery\n      nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great\n      measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold. It is\n      noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to\n      pestilences and wars—errors which were wont to prevail upon every\n      appearance of a comet—were now altogether unknown. As if by some\n      sudden convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled superstition from\n      her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive\n      interest.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate\n      question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of probable\n      alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation, of possible\n      magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible\n      effect would in any manner be produced. While such discussions were going\n      on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent\n      diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as it came.\n      All human operations were suspended.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet\n      had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously recorded\n      visitation. The people now, dismissing any lingering hope that the\n      astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. The\n      chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The hearts of the stoutest of\n      our race beat violently within their bosoms. A very few days sufficed,\n      however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable We\n      could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its\n      historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous\n      novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the\n      heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and a shadow upon our brains.\n      It had taken, with inconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic\n      mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we\n      were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even felt\n      an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The exceeding tenuity\n      of the object of our dread was apparent; for all heavenly objects were\n      plainly visible through it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly\n      altered; and we gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the\n      foresight of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown\n      before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now\n      evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come over\n      all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general\n      lamentation and horror. This first sense of pain lay in a rigorous\n      constriction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the\n      skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected;\n      the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to\n      which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result\n      of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through\n      the universal heart of man.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of\n      oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of\n      oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the\n      atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle\n      of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was\n      the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the\n      contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. An\n      unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained in just\n      such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. It\n      was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe. What\n      would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion\n      irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate;—the entire\n      fulfilment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and\n      horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind? That\n      tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now\n      the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable gaseous\n      character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a day\n      again passed—bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped\n      in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously\n      through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all men; and,\n      with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens, they\n      trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon\n      us; even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief—brief\n      as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a moment there was a wild lurid light\n      alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then—let us bow down,\n      Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God!—then, there\n      came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM;\n      while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once\n      into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and\n      all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have\n      no name. Thus ended all.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap4.23\"></a>SHADOW—A PARABLE</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the <i>Shadow.</i><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—<i>Psalm of David</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long\n      since gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things\n      shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass\n      away, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be\n      some to disbelieve, and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to\n      ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense than\n      terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and\n      signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black\n      wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless,\n      cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect\n      of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that now\n      had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year\n      when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the\n      red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I\n      mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of\n      the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of mankind.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble hall,\n      in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven. And\n      to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and\n      the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare\n      workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise, in the\n      gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the\n      peopleless streets—but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would\n      not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of which I can\n      render no distinct account—things material and spiritual—heaviness\n      in the atmosphere—a sense of suffocation—anxiety—and,\n      above all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience\n      when the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of\n      thought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our limbs—upon\n      the household furniture—upon the goblets from which we drank; and\n      all things were depressed, and borne down thereby—all things save\n      only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel. Uprearing\n      themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all\n      pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon\n      the round table of ebony at which we sat, each of us there assembled\n      beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the\n      downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our\n      proper way—which was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon—which\n      are madness; and drank deeply—although the purple wine reminded us\n      of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of\n      young Zoilus. Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the genius and\n      the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in our mirth, save that\n      his countenance, distorted with the plague, and his eyes, in which Death\n      had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such\n      interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of\n      those who are to die. But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the\n      departed were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the\n      bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths\n      of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the\n      son of Teios. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes,\n      rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak,\n      and undistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sable\n      draperies where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark\n      and undefined shadow—a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven,\n      might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow neither of\n      man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quivering awhile among the\n      draperies of the room, it at length rested in full view upon the surface\n      of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and formless, and\n      indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor of God—neither God\n      of Greece, nor God of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow\n      rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of\n      the door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary\n      and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I remember\n      aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the\n      seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among\n      the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and\n      gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I,\n      Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and\n      its appellation. And the shadow answered, “I am SHADOW, and my dwelling is\n      near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of\n      Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal.” And then did we, the\n      seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, and\n      shuddering, and aghast, for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not\n      the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in\n      their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in the\n      well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.\n    </p>\n<pre></pre>"

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.1\"></a>THE PURLOINED LETTER</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nNil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio.—<i>Seneca</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18-, I was\n      enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company\n      with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or\n      book-closet, <i>au troisième</i>, No. 33, <i>Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain</i>. For\n      one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any\n      casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with\n      the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.\n      For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had\n      formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the\n      evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending\n      the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a\n      coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted\n      our old acquaintance, Monsieur G——, the Prefect of the Parisian\n      police.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the\n      entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him\n      for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose\n      for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so,\n      upon G.‘s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the\n      opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a\n      great deal of trouble.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he forebore\n      to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had a fashion\n      of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his comprehension, and thus\n      lived amid an absolute legion of “oddities.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and\n      rolled towards him a comfortable chair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And what is the difficulty now?” I asked. “Nothing more in the\n      assassination way, I hope?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple\n      indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well\n      ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it,\n      because it is so excessively odd.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been a\n      good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us\n      altogether.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,”\n       said my friend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What nonsense you do talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,” said Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A little too self-evident.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha—ha! ha! ha!—ho! ho! ho!” roared our visitor,\n      profoundly amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And what, after all, is the matter on hand?” I asked.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady and\n      contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. “I will tell you in\n      a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an\n      affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably\n      lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any\n      one.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Proceed,” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Or not,” said Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high\n      quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been\n      purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is\n      known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,\n      that it still remains in his possession.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How is this known?” asked Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature of the\n      document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at\n      once arise from its passing out of the robber’s possession; that is to\n      say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Be a little more explicit,” I said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a\n      certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely\n      valuable.” The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be\n      nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted\n      station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over\n      the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the robber’s\n      knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who would dare—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D——, who dares all things,\n      those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft\n      was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question—a letter,\n      to be frank—had been received by the personage robbed while alone in\n      the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the\n      entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her\n      wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a\n      drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The\n      address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the\n      letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D——. His\n      lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of\n      the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and\n      fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in\n      his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in\n      question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close\n      juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes,\n      upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from\n      the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw,\n      but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of\n      the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving\n      his own letter—one of no importance—upon the table.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you demand to\n      make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s\n      knowledge of the robber.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for some\n      months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous\n      extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of\n      the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be\n      done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to\n      me.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no more\n      sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that some such\n      opinion may have been entertained.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still in\n      possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any\n      employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the\n      power departs.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was\n      to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and here my chief\n      embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.\n      Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result\n      from giving him reason to suspect our design.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But,” said I, “you are quite au fait in these investigations. The\n      Parisian police have done this thing often before.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister\n      gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all\n      night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance\n      from their master’s apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily\n      made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or\n      cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the\n      greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking\n      the D—— Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great\n      secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I\n      had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than\n      myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the\n      premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter may be in\n      possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed\n      it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar condition of\n      affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D—— is\n      known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the\n      document—its susceptibility of being produced at a moment’s notice—a\n      point of nearly equal importance with its possession.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for\n      its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of\n      the question.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if by\n      footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D——, I\n      presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated\n      these waylayings, as a matter of course.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I take to\n      be only one remove from a fool.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum,\n      “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched <i>everywhere</i>. I have\n      had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by\n      room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the\n      furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I\n      presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as\n      a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ \n      drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain.\n      There is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for\n      in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line\n      could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions\n      we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the\n      tables we removed the tops.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why so?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of\n      furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then\n      the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top\n      replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of\n      cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to\n      proceed without noise.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to pieces\n      all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a\n      deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin\n      spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large\n      knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a\n      chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every\n      chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of\n      furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any\n      traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it\n      instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as\n      obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing—any unusual gaping\n      in the joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,\n      and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and\n      carpets.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of\n      the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided\n      its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none\n      might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch\n      throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,\n      with the microscope, as before.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a great deal\n      of trouble.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You include the grounds about the houses?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little\n      trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it\n      undisturbed.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You looked among D——‘s papers, of course, and into the books of the\n      library?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every\n      book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting\n      ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our\n      police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with\n      the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous\n      scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled\n      with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have\n      escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the\n      binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the\n      microscope.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And the paper on the walls?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You looked into the cellars?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “We did.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is\n      not upon the premises, as you suppose.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin, what\n      would you advise me to do?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “That is absolutely needless,” replied G——. “I am not more sure that\n      I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of course,\n      an accurate description of the letter?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,\n      proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially\n      of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing\n      the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely\n      depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us\n      occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered\n      into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, but G——, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at\n      last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the\n      Minister?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however, as\n      Dupin suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, a very great deal—a very liberal reward—I don’t like to\n      say how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t mind\n      giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could\n      obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more\n      importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were\n      trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum,\n      “I really—think, G——, you have not exerted yourself—to\n      the utmost in this matter. You might—do a little more, I think, eh?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How?—in what way?” \n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ\n      counsel in the matter, eh?—puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the\n      story they tell of Abernethy?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No; hang Abernethy!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich\n      miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical\n      opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a\n      private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an\n      imaginary individual.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such and such;\n      now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’ \n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly willing to\n      take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand francs\n      to any one who would aid me in the matter.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a\n      check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned.\n      When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For\n      some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously\n      at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their\n      sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a\n      pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and\n      signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table\n      to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his\n      pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave\n      it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy,\n      opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and\n      then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length\n      unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a\n      syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their way. They\n      are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the\n      knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G——\n      detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D——, I\n      felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation—so\n      far as his labors extended.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “So far as his labors extended?” said I.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best of their\n      kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been\n      deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a\n      question, have found it.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and well\n      executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to\n      the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the\n      Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his\n      designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the\n      matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew\n      one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of\n      ‘even and odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is\n      played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys,\n      and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is\n      right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I\n      allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle\n      of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the\n      astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his\n      opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ \n      Our schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he\n      wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even upon the\n      first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have\n      them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;’—he guesses\n      odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would\n      have reasoned thus: ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I\n      guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the\n      first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first\n      simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple\n      a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I\n      will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode\n      of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what,\n      in its last analysis, is it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s intellect\n      with that of his opponent.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he\n      effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I\n      received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out how wise, or how\n      stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at\n      the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as\n      possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see\n      what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\n      correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy lies at\n      the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to\n      Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect with that\n      of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy\n      with which the opponent’s intellect is admeasured.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin; “and the\n      Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this\n      identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through\n      non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They\n      consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything\n      hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They\n      are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful\n      representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual\n      felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of\n      course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually\n      when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their\n      investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency—by\n      some extraordinary reward—they extend or exaggerate their old modes\n      of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this\n      case of D——, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is\n      all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the\n      microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square\n      inches—what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the\n      one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one\n      set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the\n      long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken\n      it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly\n      in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some\n      out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which\n      would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a\n      chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchés nooks for\n      concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted\n      only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal\n      of the article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is,\n      in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its\n      discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the\n      mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case\n      is of importance—or, what amounts to the same thing in the political\n      eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the qualities in question\n      have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in\n      suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the\n      limits of the Prefect’s examination—in other words, had the\n      principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of\n      the Prefect—its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond\n      question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and\n      the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister\n      is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets;\n      this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii\n      in thence inferring that all poets are fools.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers, I know;\n      and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has\n      written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician, and\n      no poet.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and mathematician,\n      he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at\n      all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been\n      contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught\n      the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been\n      regarded as the reason par excellence.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que toute\n      idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car elle a convenue\n      au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their\n      best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is\n      none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a\n      better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into\n      application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular\n      deception; but if a term is of any importance—if words derive any\n      value from applicability—then ‘analysis’ conveys ‘algebra’ about as\n      much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies ‘ambition,’ ‘<i>religio</i>’ ‘religion,’ or\n      ‘<i>homines honesti</i>’ a set of <i>honorable</i> men.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the algebraists\n      of Paris; but proceed.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is\n      cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I\n      dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The\n      mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning\n      is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great\n      error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure\n      algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious\n      that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.\n      Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of\n      relation—of form and quantity—is often grossly false in regard\n      to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue\n      that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the\n      axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,\n      each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal\n      to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical\n      truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the\n      mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they\n      were of an absolutely general applicability—as the world indeed\n      imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions an\n      analogous source of error, when he says that ‘although the Pagan fables\n      are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences\n      from them as existing realities.’ With the algebraists, however, who are\n      Pagans themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and the inferences are\n      made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable\n      addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere\n      mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not\n      clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x<sup>2</sup>+px was\n      absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen,\n      by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur\n      where x<sup>2</sup>+px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him\n      understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient,\n      for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last\n      observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician,\n      the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I\n      know him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were\n      adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he\n      was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant.\n      Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary\n      policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate—and\n      events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate—the waylayings\n      to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret\n      investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night,\n      which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I\n      regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the\n      police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G——,\n      in fact, did finally arrive—the conviction that the letter was not\n      upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I\n      was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable\n      principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed—I\n      felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the\n      mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the\n      ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as\n      not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be\n      as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the\n      gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he\n      would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately\n      induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how\n      desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first\n      interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on\n      account of its being so very self-evident.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would\n      have fallen into convulsions.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict analogies\n      to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the\n      rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an\n      argument, as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis\n      inertiæ, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It\n      is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty\n      set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is\n      commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that\n      intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and\n      more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the\n      less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the\n      first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of\n      the street signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of\n      attention?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played upon a map. One\n      party playing requires another to find a given word—the name of\n      town, river, state or empire—any word, in short, upon the motley and\n      perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to\n      embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;\n      but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one\n      end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs\n      and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being\n      excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely\n      analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to\n      pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too\n      palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or\n      beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it\n      probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter\n      immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing\n      any portion of that world from perceiving it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating\n      ingenuity of D——; upon the fact that the document must always have\n      been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the\n      decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within\n      the limits of that dignitary’s ordinary search—the more satisfied I\n      became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the\n      comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at\n      all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,\n      and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel.\n      I found D—— at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and\n      pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most\n      really energetic human being now alive—but that is only when nobody\n      sees him.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the\n      necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and\n      thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon\n      the conversation of my host.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and\n      upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers,\n      with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after\n      a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular\n      suspicion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery\n      fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue\n      ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the\n      mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were\n      five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much\n      soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle—as\n      if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless,\n      had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal,\n      bearing the D—— cipher <i>very</i> conspicuously, and was addressed, in a\n      diminutive female hand, to D——, the minister, himself. It was thrust\n      carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the\n      uppermost divisions of the rack.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that of\n      which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically\n      different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a\n      description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D—— cipher;\n      there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S—— family.\n      Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine; there the\n      superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and\n      decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the\n      radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the\n      soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true\n      methodical habits of D——, and so suggestive of a design to delude the\n      beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document—these things,\n      together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this document, full in the\n      view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions\n      to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly\n      corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most\n      animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had\n      never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really\n      riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its\n      external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length,\n      upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have\n      entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be\n      more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance\n      which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and\n      pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same\n      creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was\n      sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a\n      glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good\n      morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the\n      table.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite\n      eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,\n      however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath\n      the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful\n      screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D—— rushed to a\n      casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the\n      card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a\n      fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully prepared\n      at my lodgings—imitating the D—— cipher, very readily, by means\n      of a seal formed of bread.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior\n      of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and\n      children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow\n      was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D——\n      came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing\n      the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended\n      lunatic was a man in my own pay.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter by a\n      fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have\n      seized it openly, and departed?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “D——,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His\n      hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made\n      the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial\n      presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more.\n      But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political\n      prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned.\n      For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him\n      in hers—since, being unaware that the letter is not in his\n      possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he\n      inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His\n      downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very\n      well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of\n      climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than\n      to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy—at least no\n      pity—for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an\n      unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very\n      well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by\n      her whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to opening\n      the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How? did you put any thing particular in it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank—that\n      would have been insulting. D——, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,\n      which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I\n      knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person\n      who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is\n      well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the\n      blank sheet the words—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      “‘— — Un dessein si funeste,<br>\n      S’il n’est digne d’Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.\n     </p>\n<p>\n      They are to be found in Crébillon’s ‘Atrée.’”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.2\"></a>THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nTruth is stranger than fiction.—<i>Old Saying</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental\n      investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsöornot, a work which (like\n      the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe;\n      and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American—if\n      we except, perhaps, the author of the “Curiosities of American\n      Literature”;—having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of\n      the first-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to\n      discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error\n      respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Scheherazade, as that fate\n      is depicted in the “Arabian Nights”; and that the <i>dénouement</i> there given,\n      if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to blame in\n      not having gone very much farther.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the\n      inquisitive reader to the “Isitsöornot” itself; but in the meantime, I\n      shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a certain\n      monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only puts her to\n      death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to espouse each\n      night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the next morning to\n      deliver her up to the executioner.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a\n      religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a\n      man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one\n      afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to\n      whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either redeem\n      the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish, after the\n      approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which makes\n      the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grand vizier,\n      to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the king eagerly\n      accepts—(he had intended to take it at all events, and had put off\n      the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),—but,\n      in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand,\n      that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of\n      giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore, the\n      fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actually marry\n      him despite her father’s excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind—when\n      she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it was with her\n      beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would\n      allow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading\n      Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her mind.\n      On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what specious\n      pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the\n      royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed; and, a little\n      before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband\n      (who bore her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on\n      the morrow),—she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on account\n      of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept well) by the\n      profound interest of a story (about a rat and a black cat, I think) which\n      she was narrating (all in an undertone, of course) to her sister. When the\n      day broke, it so happened that this history was not altogether finished,\n      and that Scheherazade, in the nature of things could not finish it just\n      then, since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung—a\n      thing very little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over\n      his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone the\n      fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with the\n      hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat (a\n      black cat, I think it was) and the rat.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put the\n      finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue) but\n      before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the\n      intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether\n      mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent\n      manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With this\n      history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other—and,\n      as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen’s\n      endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing), there was\n      again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before, for twenty-four\n      hours. The next night there happened a similar accident with a similar\n      result; and then the next—and then again the next; so that, in the\n      end, the good monarch, having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity\n      to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one\n      nights, either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or\n      gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more probable)\n      breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father confessor. At all\n      events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir,\n      perhaps, to the whole seven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all\n      know, picked up from under the trees in the garden of Eden; Scheherazade,\n      I say, finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon\n      record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant—but alas! like\n      a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am\n      indebted altogether to the “Isitsöornot” for the means of correcting the\n      error. “Le mieux,” says a French proverb, “est l’ennemi du bien,” and, in\n      mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk, I\n      should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they\n      amounted to seventy-seven.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote the\n      language of the “Isitsöornot” at this point, verbatim) “my dear sister,”\n       said she, “now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring has\n      blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily repealed, I feel that I\n      have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the\n      king (who I am sorry to say, snores—a thing no gentleman would do)\n      the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor. This person went through\n      numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which I related;\n      but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their\n      narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short—a grievous\n      piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will forgive me.\n      But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect—and as\n      soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so\n      far that he may stop making that horrible noise, I will forthwith\n      entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequel of this very\n      remarkable story.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the “Isitsöornot,”\n       expressed no very particular intensity of gratification; but the king,\n      having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased snoring, and finally\n      said, “Hum!” and then “Hoo!” when the queen, understanding these words\n      (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and\n      would do his best not to snore any more—the queen, I say, having\n      arranged these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into\n      the history of Sinbad the sailor:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as\n      retailed by Scheherazade]—‘at length, in my old age, and after\n      enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed\n      of a desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without\n      acquainting any of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of\n      such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaging a\n      porter to carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the\n      arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into\n      some region which I had not as yet explored.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath some\n      trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship, but\n      during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied that I\n      could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, after\n      listening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presently it\n      grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that\n      the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, on the edge of\n      the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in size\n      until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a great part of\n      its body above the surface of the sea. It came toward us with\n      inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast,\n      and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed, with a\n      long line of fire that extended far off into the distance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was equal\n      to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as wide as\n      the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificent\n      of the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as\n      solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion of\n      it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red\n      streak that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath the\n      surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the\n      monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely covered with metallic\n      scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather. The back was\n      flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards of six spines,\n      about half the length of the whole body.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive; but, as if to\n      make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four score of\n      eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the green\n      dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one above\n      the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answer\n      the purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much\n      larger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the\n      greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy—for\n      it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like\n      the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet did\n      it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail were shaped\n      precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that\n      served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick\n      breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking, disagreeable noise.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was\n      even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we\n      perceived upon the creature’s back a vast number of animals about the size\n      and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that they\n      wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an\n      ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight\n      to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put\n      them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads were\n      certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought might have\n      been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered that they were\n      excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded they were\n      contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the heads of the\n      animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around the necks of the\n      creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,)\n      such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so\n      that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in\n      any direction without moving the body at the same time; and thus they were\n      doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses—a view puggish and\n      snubby in a wonderful, if not positively in an awful degree.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it\n      suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from it\n      a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and a\n      noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke cleared\n      away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the\n      large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his\n      mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents,\n      that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not come\n      altogether through the nose.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I could\n      in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty I turned to\n      the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and demanded of him\n      his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what it wanted, and what\n      kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back. To this the\n      porter replied, as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once\n      before heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels of\n      sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means of\n      inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back were vermin,\n      such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a little larger and more\n      savage; and that these vermin had their uses, however evil—for,\n      through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and stingings,\n      it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it\n      roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of\n      the wicked genii.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even\n      looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the porter\n      ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so that, by\n      these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of which I have\n      no doubt he took excellent care—although this is a point I cannot\n      determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (who had\n      come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, bound hand and\n      foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out again into the\n      middle of the sea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril\n      my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, I made the\n      best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the\n      man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exercise authority\n      over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this endeavor that, in a few\n      days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in\n      the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it\n      was vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was\n      enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it comprehend the\n      ardent desire I had of seeing the world.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt grumble,\n      hiss, fiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one day after dinner—but I beg a\n      thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with\n      the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals were called; I presume\n      because their language formed the connecting link between that of the\n      horse and that of the rooster). With your permission, I will translate.\n      ‘Washish squashish,’ and so forth:—that is to say, ‘I am happy to\n      find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a very excellent fellow; we are\n      now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the globe; and\n      since you are so desirous of seeing the world, I will strain a point and\n      give you a free passage upon back of the beast.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the\n      “Isitsöornot,” the king turned over from his left side to his right, and\n      said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,\n      hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think them\n      exceedingly entertaining and strange?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair Scheherazade\n      resumed her history in the following words:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative—‘I\n      thanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much\n      at home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;\n      although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, by no\n      means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went—so to say—either\n      up hill or down hill all the time.’ \n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That I think, was very singular,” interrupted the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; “but, pray, be so good as to go on\n      with the story.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I will,” said the queen. “‘The beast,’ continued Sinbad to the caliph,\n      ‘swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, we\n      arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, but which,\n      nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of\n      little things like caterpillars.’” (*1)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hum!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad—(for Scheherazade, it must be\n      understood, took no notice of her husband’s ill-mannered ejaculation)\n      ‘leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of solid\n      stone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axes\n      with which we endeavoured to cut them down.’” (*2)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,\n      continued in the language of Sinbad.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where there was a\n      cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels\n      of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and\n      more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all Damascus and Bagdad.\n      From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads of gems, like\n      diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streets of towers and\n      pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and\n      swarming with fish that had no eyes.’” (*3)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hum!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a\n      lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal,\n      some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long (*4); while\n      from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the\n      sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it became darker than\n      the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at the distance of a\n      hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was impossible to see the\n      whitest object, however close we held it to our eyes.’” (*5)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hum!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we met\n      with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed—for we\n      here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feet\n      beneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a forest\n      of tall and luxuriant trees.’” (*6)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hoo!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the\n      atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own does\n      feather.’” (*7)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Fiddle de dee,” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the most\n      magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered a\n      glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of\n      unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber. It was\n      from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on either side\n      to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were crowned with\n      ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that made the\n      whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of this luxuriant land\n      was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable death.’” (*8)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Humph!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to\n      another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals\n      with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideous beasts dig\n      for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape, and line the\n      sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the other that they fall\n      instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thus precipitating them\n      into the monster’s dens, where their blood is immediately sucked, and\n      their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense\n      distance from “the caverns of death.\"’” (*9)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Pooh!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables that\n      grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others that sprang\n      from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that derived their\n      substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again, there\n      were others that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others that\n      moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still more\n      wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their\n      limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of mankind for\n      enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid and solitary\n      prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.’” (*15)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Pshaw!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the\n      birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that they give\n      daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the\n      empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of\n      two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the spot—the one\n      by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king keeping their\n      solution a secret, it was only after the most profound researches and\n      labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long series\n      of years, that the men-mathematicians at length arrived at the identical\n      solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the\n      birds.’” (*16)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh my!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close\n      upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls\n      a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; so that, although\n      they flew a mile during every minute, it required no less than four hours\n      for the whole flock to pass over us—in which there were several\n      millions of millions of fowl.’” (*17)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Oh fy!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great\n      annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another\n      kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my former\n      voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your seraglio,\n      oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we\n      could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a\n      prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth,\n      shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the monster was\n      bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from which it had\n      knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human\n      beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful despair at the\n      horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all our might, in the\n      hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely\n      gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a\n      heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Stuff!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of\n      immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, was\n      supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer than\n      four hundred horns.’” (*18)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “That, now, I believe,” said the king, “because I have read something of\n      the kind before, in a book.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “‘We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between the\n      legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a wonderful\n      country indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was his own\n      native land, inhabited by things of his own species. This elevated the\n      man-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel\n      ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him; for\n      I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most powerful\n      magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19) which, no doubt,\n      served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and wrigglings to the\n      most miraculous efforts of imagination!’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Nonsense!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very singular\n      kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose\n      blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black stones for his\n      usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was so strong and\n      swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest temple in\n      this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds.’” (*20)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Twattle!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger than\n      a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her blood, like\n      that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly related,) was boiling\n      water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones. This hen\n      brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after\n      birth, they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach\n      of their mother.’” (*21)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Fal lal!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and\n      wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have\n      beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of the great\n      Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed (of like\n      material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it;\n      for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed\n      calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united\n      labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23) But a still more\n      wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither\n      man nor beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixed with a black\n      matter like pitch, and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed\n      and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty\n      thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and this with so exquisite a\n      precision, that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary\n      from another by the breadth of the finest hair. This thing was of\n      prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew the mightiest empires\n      at a breath; but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for\n      good.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ridiculous!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his\n      veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sitting down\n      to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly\n      roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty of converting the\n      common metals into gold, without even looking at them during the process.\n      (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as\n      to be invisible. (*26) Another had such quickness of perception that he\n      counted all the separate motions of an elastic body, while it was\n      springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of\n      times in a second.’” (*27)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Absurd!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet\n      saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick out\n      their legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28) Another had\n      cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself\n      heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29) Another had so long an\n      arm that he could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter at Bagdad—or\n      indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded the lightning\n      to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at his call; and\n      served him for a plaything when it came. Another took two loud sounds and\n      out of them made a silence. Another constructed a deep darkness out of two\n      brilliant lights. (*31) Another made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32)\n      Another directed the sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did. (*33)\n      Another took this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first\n      weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths and found\n      out the solidity of the substance of which they were made. But the whole\n      nation is, indeed, of so surprising a necromantic ability, that not even\n      their infants, nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in\n      seeing objects that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of\n      years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the\n      face of creation.’” (*34)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Preposterous!” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,’”\n       continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by these\n      frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her husband—“‘the\n      wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every thing that is\n      accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and\n      beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from which\n      not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has,\n      hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come in certain shapes,\n      and some in others—but this of which I speak has come in the shape\n      of a crotchet.’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A what?” said the king.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “‘A crotchet’” said Scheherazade. “‘One of the evil genii, who are\n      perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads of\n      these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal\n      beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies\n      not very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they\n      say, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long\n      possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country, the days\n      have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a\n      dromedary—’”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Stop!” said the king—“I can’t stand that, and I won’t. You have\n      already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I\n      perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?—my\n      conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary\n      touch—do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well\n      get up and be throttled.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      These words, as I learn from the “Isitsöornot,” both grieved and\n      astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of\n      scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she\n      submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great\n      consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the reflection\n      that much of the history remained still untold, and that the petulance of\n      her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous reward, in\n      depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.3\"></a>A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.</h2>\n<p class=\"letter\">\n  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our\n  ways;  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the\n  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, <i>which have\n  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus</i>.\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n—<i>Joseph Glanville</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the\n      old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on this\n      route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,\n      there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man—or\n      at least such as no man ever survived to tell of—and the six hours\n      of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You\n      suppose me a <i>very</i> old man—but I am not. It took less than a\n      single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my\n      limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion,\n      and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look over this\n      little cliff without getting giddy?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself\n      down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he\n      was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and\n      slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose, a sheer unobstructed\n      precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from\n      the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to within\n      half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the\n      perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the\n      ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at\n      the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that\n      the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the\n      winds. It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to\n      sit up and look out into the distance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have brought you\n      here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event\n      I mentioned—and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under\n      your eye.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which\n      distinguished him—“we are now close upon the Norwegian coast—in\n      the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of\n      Nordland—and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon\n      whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little\n      higher—hold on to the grass if you feel giddy—so—and\n      look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so\n      inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer’s account\n      of the <i>Mare Tenebrarum</i>. A panorama more deplorably desolate no\n      human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye\n      could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of\n      horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the\n      more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its\n      white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just opposite the\n      promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five\n      or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island;\n      or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of\n      surge in which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose\n      another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at\n      various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island\n      and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at the time,\n      so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay\n      to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull\n      out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only\n      a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction—as\n      well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little\n      except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by the\n      Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward\n      is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and\n      Buckholm. Farther off—between Moskoe and Vurrgh—are Otterholm,\n      Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the places—but\n      why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either\n      you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in\n      the water?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we\n      had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no\n      glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the old\n      man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like\n      the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at\n      the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the <i>chopping</i>\n      character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current\n      which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a\n      monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its headlong\n      impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed\n      into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the\n      main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and\n      scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into\n      phrensied convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in\n      gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the\n      eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in\n      precipitous descents.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical\n      alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the\n      whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam\n      became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at length,\n      spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took\n      unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed\n      to form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this\n      assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile\n      in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of\n      gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the\n      terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a\n      smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at\n      an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with\n      a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an\n      appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty\n      cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw\n      myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of\n      nervous agitation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this <i>can</i> be nothing\n      else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the\n      Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what\n      I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of\n      any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence, or\n      of the horror of the scene—or of the wild bewildering sense of <i>the\n      novel</i> which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what point of\n      view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could\n      neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There\n      are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted\n      for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in\n      conveying an impression of the spectacle.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is between\n      thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh)\n      this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a\n      vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in\n      the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the country\n      between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its\n      impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most\n      dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the\n      vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes\n      within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the\n      bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water\n      relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of\n      tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm\n      weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually\n      returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by\n      a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats,\n      yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before\n      they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently, that whales\n      come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it\n      is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless\n      struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from\n      Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he\n      roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine\n      trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to\n      such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom\n      to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This\n      stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea—it being\n      constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in\n      the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity\n      that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have\n      been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The\n      “forty fathoms” must have reference only to portions of the channel close\n      upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the\n      Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this\n      fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into\n      the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of\n      Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon\n      below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest\n      Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the\n      whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident\n      thing, that the largest ship of the line in existence, coming within the\n      influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a\n      feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, I\n      remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal—now wore a\n      very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is\n      that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands,\n      “have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at\n      flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the\n      water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher\n      the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of\n      all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is\n      sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”—These are the words of\n      the Encyclopædia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre\n      of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe, and\n      issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat\n      decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself, was the one\n      to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and,\n      mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that,\n      although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by\n      the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion\n      he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him—for,\n      however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and\n      even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if you\n      will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar\n      of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to\n      know something of the Moskoe-ström.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about\n      seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the\n      islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea\n      there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the\n      courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we\n      three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the\n      islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to\n      the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and\n      therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here among the\n      rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater\n      abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of\n      the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made it a\n      matter of desperate speculation—the risk of life standing instead of\n      labor, and courage answering for capital.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than\n      this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the\n      fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main channel of the\n      Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage\n      somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so\n      violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for\n      slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out\n      upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming—one\n      that we felt sure would not fail us before our return—and we seldom\n      made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were\n      forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a\n      rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain on the\n      grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up\n      shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be\n      thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in\n      spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so\n      violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had\n      not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents—here\n      to-day and gone to-morrow—which drove us under the lee of Flimen,\n      where, by good luck, we brought up.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\n      encountered ‘on the grounds’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in good\n      weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\n      Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has been\n      in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the\n      slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting,\n      and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current\n      rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen\n      years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been of\n      great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward\n      in fishing—but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had\n      not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger—for, after\n      all is said and done, it <i>was</i> a horrible danger, and that is the\n      truth.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell\n      you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18—, a day which the people\n      of this part of the world will never forget—for it was one in which\n      blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens. And\n      yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a\n      gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone\n      brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what\n      was to follow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed over\n      to the islands about two o’clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the\n      smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day\n      than we had ever known them. It was just seven, <i>by my watch</i>, when\n      we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at\n      slack water, which we knew would be at eight.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time\n      spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw\n      not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we were taken aback\n      by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most unusual—something\n      that had never happened to us before—and I began to feel a little\n      uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but\n      could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of\n      proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the\n      whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with\n      the most amazing velocity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were\n      dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of things,\n      however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it. In\n      less than a minute the storm was upon us—in less than two the sky\n      was entirely overcast—and what with this and the driving spray, it\n      became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The\n      oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let\n      our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first\n      puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off—the\n      mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it\n      for safety.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water. It\n      had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this\n      hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the\n      Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this\n      circumstance we should have foundered at once—for we lay entirely\n      buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot\n      say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon\n      as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet\n      against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a\n      ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere instinct that\n      prompted me to do this—which was undoubtedly the very best thing I\n      could have done—for I was too much flurried to think.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time\n      I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no longer I\n      raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus\n      got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as\n      a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some\n      measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor\n      that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to\n      be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder brother, and\n      my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard—but\n      the next moment all this joy was turned into horror—for he put his\n      mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word ‘<i>Moskoe-ström!</i>’ \n    </p>\n<p>\n      “No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook from\n      head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I knew what\n      he meant by that one word well enough—I knew what he wished to make\n      me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the\n      whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You perceive that in crossing the Ström <i>channel</i>, we always went a\n      long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to\n      wait and watch carefully for the slack—but now we were driving right\n      upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! ‘To be sure,’ I\n      thought, ‘we shall get there just about the slack—there is some\n      little hope in that’—but in the next moment I cursed myself for\n      being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we\n      were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps\n      we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events the\n      seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and\n      frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change, too, had\n      come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still as black as\n      pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift\n      of clear sky—as clear as I ever saw—and of a deep bright blue—and\n      through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never\n      before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with the greatest\n      distinctness—but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother—but, in some\n      manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could\n      not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my\n      voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death,\n      and held up one of his fingers, as if to say <i>‘listen! ‘</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      “At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a hideous\n      thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not\n      going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears\n      as I flung it far away into the ocean. <i>It had run down at seven\n      o’clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström\n      was in full fury!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      “When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the\n      waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from\n      beneath her—which appears very strange to a landsman—and this\n      is what is called <i>riding</i>, in sea phrase.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently\n      a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us\n      with it as it rose—up—up—as if into the sky. I would\n      not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came\n      with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as\n      if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we\n      were up I had thrown a quick glance around—and that one glance was\n      all sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Ström\n      whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more like\n      the every-day Moskoe-Ström than the whirl as you now see it, is like a\n      mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I\n      should not have recognised the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily\n      closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched themselves together as if in\n      a spasm.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly\n      felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat made a sharp\n      half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a\n      thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was\n      completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek—such a sound as you\n      might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels,\n      letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that\n      always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another moment\n      would plunge us into the abyss, down which we could only see\n      indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne\n      along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim\n      like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her starboard side was\n      next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.\n      It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the\n      gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having\n      made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror\n      which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung my\n      nerves.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I\n      began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner,\n      and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my\n      own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God’s\n      power. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my\n      mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity\n      about the whirl itself. I positively felt a <i>wish</i> to explore its\n      depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief\n      was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about\n      the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to\n      occupy a man’s mind in such extremity—and I have often thought\n      since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have\n      rendered me a little light-headed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There was another circumstance which tended to restore my\n      self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not\n      reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw yourself, the belt\n      of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this\n      latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you have\n      never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion\n      of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen, and\n      strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection. But we were\n      now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances—just as\n      death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden\n      them while their doom is yet uncertain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We\n      careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating,\n      getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge, and then\n      nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I had never\n      let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding on to a\n      small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of\n      the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept\n      overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the\n      pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in\n      the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not\n      large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief\n      than when I saw him attempt this act—although I knew he was a madman\n      when he did it—a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care,\n      however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make no difference\n      whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went\n      astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the\n      smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel—only swaying\n      to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely\n      had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to\n      starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried prayer\n      to God, and thought all was over.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively\n      tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds I\n      dared not open them—while I expected instant destruction, and\n      wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. But\n      moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had\n      ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,\n      while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along.\n      I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with\n      which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic,\n      midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference,\n      prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been\n      mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun\n      around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the\n      rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I\n      have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the\n      black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The\n      general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I recovered\n      myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward. In this\n      direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in\n      which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She was quite\n      upon an even keel—that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel\n      with that of the water—but this latter sloped at an angle of more\n      than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends.\n      I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more\n      difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation, than if\n      we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to the speed\n      at which we revolved.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound\n      gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick\n      mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there hung a\n      magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmen\n      say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray,\n      was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel,\n      as they all met together at the bottom—but the yell that went up to\n      the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had\n      carried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent was by\n      no means proportionate. Round and round we swept—not with any\n      uniform movement—but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us\n      sometimes only a few hundred yards—sometimes nearly the complete\n      circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was slow,\n      but very perceptible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were\n      thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the\n      embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of\n      vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many\n      smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels\n      and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had\n      taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I\n      drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a\n      strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company. I <i>must</i>\n      have been delirious, for I even sought <i>amusement</i> in\n      speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward\n      the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found myself at one time saying, ‘will\n      certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,’—and\n      then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship\n      overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several guesses\n      of this nature, and being deceived in all—this fact—the fact\n      of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection\n      that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more\n      exciting <i>hope</i>. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from\n      present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter\n      that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown\n      forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of the articles were\n      shattered in the most extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as\n      to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then I\n      distinctly recollected that there were <i>some</i> of them which were not\n      disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference except by\n      supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been\n      <i>completely absorbed</i>—that the others had entered the whirl at\n      so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason, had descended so slowly\n      after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the\n      flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible,\n      in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level\n      of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in\n      more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important\n      observations. The first was, that, as a general rule, the larger the\n      bodies were, the more rapid their descent—the second, that, between\n      two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other <i>of any\n      other shape</i>, the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere—the\n      third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and\n      the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.\n      Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an\n      old school-master of the district; and it was from him that I learned the\n      use of the words ‘cylinder’ and ‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although\n      I have forgotten the explanation—how what I observed was, in fact,\n      the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments—and\n      showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered\n      more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty\n      than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing\n      these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to account, and\n      this was that, at every revolution, we passed something like a barrel, or\n      else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of these things, which\n      had been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the\n      whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little\n      from their original station.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to\n      the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter,\n      and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother’s\n      attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and\n      did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about to do.\n      I thought at length that he comprehended my design—but, whether this\n      was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move\n      from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him; the\n      emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned\n      him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings\n      which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the\n      sea, without another moment’s hesitation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself\n      who now tell you this tale—as you see that I <i>did</i> escape—and\n      as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was\n      effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say—I\n      will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or\n      thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast\n      distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid\n      succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at\n      once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I was\n      attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the\n      bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a\n      great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of\n      the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep. The\n      gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees,\n      the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed\n      slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full\n      moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface\n      of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot\n      where the pool of the Moskoe-ström <i>had been</i>. It was the hour of the\n      slack—but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects\n      of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström, and\n      in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the ‘grounds’ of the\n      fishermen. A boat picked me up—exhausted from fatigue—and (now\n      that the danger was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.\n      Those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions—but\n      they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the\n      spirit-land. My hair which had been raven-black the day before, was as\n      white as you see it now. They say too that the whole expression of my\n      countenance had changed. I told them my story—they did not believe\n      it. I now tell it to <i>you</i>—and I can scarcely expect you to put\n      more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.4\"></a>VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY</h2>\n<p>\n      After the very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of the\n      summary in ‘Silliman’s Journal,’ with the detailed statement just\n      published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course, that in\n      offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen’s discovery, I\n      have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view. My\n      object is simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen\n      himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight personal\n      acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must necessarily, at\n      this moment, be of interest; and, in the second place, to look in a\n      general way, and speculatively, at the results of the discovery.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which I\n      have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a general\n      impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the\n      newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably\n      is, is unanticipated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By reference to the ‘Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy’ (Cottle and Munroe,\n      London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that this illustrious\n      chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question, but had actually\n      made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the very identical\n      analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who\n      although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I\n      say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to the\n      ‘Diary’ for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The paragraph from the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ which is now going the\n      rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a Mr.\n      Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little\n      apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either\n      impossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go into\n      details. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its\n      manner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom\n      so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise\n      location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he\n      says he did, at the period designated—nearly eight years ago—how\n      happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the immense\n      benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to\n      him individually, if not to the world at large, from the discovery? It\n      seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could\n      have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet have subsequently\n      acted so like a baby—so like an owl—as Mr. Kissam admits that\n      he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole paragraph in\n      the ‘Courier and Enquirer’ a fabrication got up to ‘make a talk’? It must\n      be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. Very little\n      dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if I were\n      not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of science are\n      mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry, I should be\n      profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as Professor Draper,\n      discussing Mr. Kissam’s (or is it Mr. Quizzem’s?) pretensions to the\n      discovery, in so serious a tone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But to return to the ‘Diary’ of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not\n      designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any\n      person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by\n      the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the\n      middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide of\n      azote: ‘In less than half a minute the respiration being continued,\n      diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on\n      all the muscles.’ That the respiration was not ‘diminished,’ is not only\n      clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural, ‘were.’ The\n      sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: ‘In less than half a minute, the\n      respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished gradually, and\n      were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the\n      muscles.’ A hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so\n      inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant only for\n      the writer’s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince\n      almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion. The fact is, Sir\n      Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on\n      scientific topics. Not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to\n      quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that,\n      however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track\n      in the matter now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he\n      had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily\n      believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he\n      have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this ‘Diary’ (full of\n      crude speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they\n      were. I say ‘his wishes,’ for that he meant to include this note-book\n      among the miscellaneous papers directed ‘to be burnt,’ I think there can\n      be no manner of doubt. Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by\n      bad, yet remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the\n      other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in\n      the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen\n      whether this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any\n      circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large. That\n      Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would\n      be folly to doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to\n      ‘realize,’ in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with other\n      property of intrinsic value.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the ‘Home Journal,’ \n      and has since been extensively copied, several misapprehensions of the\n      German original seem to have been made by the translator, who professes to\n      have taken the passage from a late number of the Presburg ‘Schnellpost.’ \n      ‘Viele’ has evidently been misconceived (as it often is), and what the\n      translator renders by ‘sorrows,’ is probably ‘lieden,’ which, in its true\n      version, ‘sufferings,’ would give a totally different complexion to the\n      whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely guess, on my part.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Von Kempelen, however, is by no means ‘a misanthrope,’ in appearance, at\n      least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was casual\n      altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him at all;\n      but to have seen and conversed with a man of so <i>prodigious</i> a notoriety as\n      he has attained, or <i>will</i> attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as\n      times go.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The Literary World” speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg\n      (misled, perhaps, by the account in “The Home Journal”) but I am pleased\n      in being able to state <i>positively</i>, since I have it from his own lips, that\n      he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his parents,\n      I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way,\n      with Mäelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short and\n      stout, with large, <i>fat</i>, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but\n      pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There is some defect\n      in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his whole manner noticeable\n      for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and acts as little like ‘a\n      misanthrope’ as any man I ever saw. We were fellow-sojourners for a week\n      about six years ago, at Earl’s Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I\n      presume that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or\n      four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the day; and\n      nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments.\n      He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to\n      Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made\n      public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having\n      made it. This is about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von\n      Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would have\n      interest for the public.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat\n      about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit as\n      the story of Aladdin’s lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in the\n      case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth may be\n      stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is so well\n      authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence\n      at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme shifts\n      in order to raise trifling sums. When the great excitement occurred about\n      the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp; Co., suspicion was directed\n      toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased a considerable\n      property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain\n      how he became possessed of the purchase money. He was at length arrested,\n      but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the end set at liberty.\n      The police, however, kept a strict watch upon his movements, and thus\n      discovered that he left home frequently, taking always the same road, and\n      invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that\n      labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the\n      ‘Dondergat.’ Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a\n      garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,—and,\n      coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his\n      counterfeiting operations. His agitation is represented as so excessive\n      that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After\n      hand-cuffing him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears\n      he occupied all the mansarde.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by\n      eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has not\n      yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very small\n      furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate\n      crucible—two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these crucibles\n      was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the\n      aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other crucible had\n      some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously\n      dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself taken, Kempelen\n      seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased in gloves that\n      afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the contents on the tiled\n      floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and before proceeding to\n      ransack the premises they searched his person, but nothing unusual was\n      found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing\n      what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some\n      unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. All\n      attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed, but that\n      it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through a\n      sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the\n      chemist’s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes, but\n      discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin, silver\n      and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair\n      trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly\n      across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk out from\n      under the bed, they found that, with their united strength (there were\n      three of them, all powerful men), they ‘could not stir it one inch.’ Much\n      astonished at this, one of them crawled under the bed, and looking into\n      the trunk, said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      ‘No wonder we couldn’t move it—why it’s full to the brim of old bits\n      of brass!’ \n    </p>\n<p>\n      Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase, and\n      pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with all theirs,\n      the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the bed, and its\n      contents examined. The supposed brass with which it was filled was all in\n      small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar;\n      but the pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less\n      flat-looking, upon the whole, “very much as lead looks when thrown upon\n      the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow cool.” Now, not\n      one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be anything\n      <i>but</i> brass. The idea of its being <i>gold</i> never entered their brains, of\n      course; how <i>could</i> such a wild fancy have entered it? And their\n      astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it became known, all\n      over Bremen, that the “lot of brass” which they had carted so\n      contemptuously to the police office, without putting themselves to the\n      trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold—real gold—but\n      gold far finer than any employed in coinage—gold, in fact, absolutely\n      pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen’s confession (as far as it\n      went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he has\n      actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the old\n      chimaera of the philosopher’s stone, no sane person is at liberty to\n      doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest\n      consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of\n      bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>. The\n      simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and until\n      Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma,\n      it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years, in statu\n      quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that ‘Pure gold\n      can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection with certain\n      other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.’ \n    </p>\n<p>\n      Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results\n      of this discovery—a discovery which few thinking persons will\n      hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold\n      generally, by the late developments in California; and this reflection\n      brings us inevitably to another—the exceeding inopportuneness of Von\n      Kempelen’s analysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to\n      California, by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially\n      diminish in value, on account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as\n      to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one—what\n      impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to emigrate,\n      and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region, by\n      the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von Kempelen? a discovery\n      which declares, in so many words, that beyond its intrinsic worth for\n      manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at\n      least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long\n      retain his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior\n      value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to speculate\n      prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery, but one thing may be\n      positively maintained—that the announcement of the discovery six\n      months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement\n      of California.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two\n      hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent.\n      that of silver.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.5\"></a>MESMERIC REVELATION</h2>\n<p>\nWhatever doubt may still envelop the <i>rationale</i> of mesmerism,\nits startling <i>facts</i> are now almost universally admitted. Of these\nlatter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession—an\nunprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste\nof time than the attempt to <i>prove</i>, at the present day, that man, by\nmere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an\nabnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those\nof <i>death</i>, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the\nphenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,\nwhile in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,\nand then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with\nkeenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,\nmatters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his\nintellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his\nsympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally,\nthat his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,\nwhile, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more\nextended and more <i>pronounced</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\nI say that these—which are the laws of mesmerism in its\ngeneral features—it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I\ninflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose\nat present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in\nthe teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very\nremarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and\nmyself.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr.\nVankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric\nperception had supervened. For many months he had been laboring under confirmed\nphthisis, the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my\nmanipulations; and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was\nsummoned to his bedside.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the\nheart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary\nsymptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief\nfrom the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night\nthis had been attempted in vain.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and\nalthough evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite\nat ease.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I sent for you to-night,” he said, “not so much to administer\nto my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal\nimpressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and\nsurprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the\ntopic of the soul’s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always\nexisted, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague\nhalf-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no\ntime amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do.\nAll attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more\nsceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied\nhim in his own works as well as in those of his European and American\nechoes. The ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed\nin my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it\nlogical, but the portions which were not <i>merely</i> logical were unhappily\nthe initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his\nsumming up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even\nsucceeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his\nbeginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in\nperceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own\nimmortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions\nwhich have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of\nFrance, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no\nhold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,\nwill always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The\nwill may assent—the soul—the intellect, never.\n</p>\n<p>\n“I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually\nbelieved. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the\nfeeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of\nreason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am\nenabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.\nI cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the\nmesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination\nwhich, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full\naccordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through\nits <i>effect</i>, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning\nand its conclusion—the cause and its effect—are present together. In\nmy natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only\npartially, remains.\n</p>\n<p>\n“These considerations have led me to think that some good\nresults might ensue from a series of well-directed questions\npropounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profound\nself-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker—the extensive knowledge he\ndisplays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and\nfrom this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of\na catechism.”\n</p>\n<p>\nI consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes\nthrew Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became\nimmediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.\nThe following conversation then ensued:—V. in the dialogue representing\nthe patient, and P. myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Are you asleep?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes—no; I would rather sleep more soundly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> [<i>After a few more passes.</i>] Do you sleep now?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> How do you think your present illness will result?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> [<i>After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort</i>.]\n      I must die.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Does the idea of death afflict you?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> [<i>Very quickly</i>.] No—no!\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Are you pleased with the prospect?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter.\n      The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel\n      able to make. You do not question me properly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> What then shall I ask?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> You must begin at the beginning.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> The beginning! But where is the beginning?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> You know that the beginning is GOD. [<i>This was said in a low,\n      fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration</i>.]\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> What then, is God?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> [<i>Hesitating for many minutes.</i>] I cannot tell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Is not God spirit?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> While I was awake I knew what you meant by “spirit,” but now it\n      seems only a word—such, for instance, as truth, beauty—a\n      quality, I mean.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Is not God immaterial?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> There is no immateriality—it is a mere word. That which is\n      not matter, is not at all—unless qualities are things.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Is God, then, material?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> No. [<i>This reply startled me very much.</i>]\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> What, then, is he?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> [<i>After a long pause, and mutteringly.</i>] I see—but it\n      is a thing difficult to tell. [<i>Another long pause.</i>] He is not\n      spirit, for he exists. Nor is he matter, as <i>you understand it</i>. But\n      there are <i>gradations</i> of matter of which man knows nothing; the\n      grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The\n      atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the electric\n      principle permeates the atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in\n      rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a matter <i>unparticled</i>—without\n      particles—indivisible—<i>one;</i> and here the law of impulsion\n      and permeation is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only\n      permeates all things but impels all things; and thus <i>is</i> all\n      things within itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in\n      the word “thought,” is this matter in motion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to\n      motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action\n      of <i>mind</i>, not of <i>thinking</i>. The unparticled matter, or\n      God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call\n      mind. And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human\n      volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and\n      omniprevalence; <i>how</i> I know not, and now clearly see that I shall\n      never know. But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or\n      quality, existing within itself, is thinking.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the\n      unparticled matter?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in\n      gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of\n      water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous\n      ether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in one\n      general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas more\n      essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that which\n      we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we feel an\n      almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with nihility.\n      The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic\n      constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an\n      atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity,\n      palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we\n      should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as\n      matter. For want of a better word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a\n      step beyond the luminiferous ether—conceive a matter as much more\n      rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we\n      arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass—an\n      unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite littleness in the\n      atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them\n      is an absurdity. There will be a point—there will be a degree of\n      rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces\n      must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of\n      the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass\n      inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear, however,\n      that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it is impossible to\n      conceive spirit, since it is impossible to imagine what is not. When we\n      flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely\n      deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified\n      matter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of\n      absolute coalescence;—and that is the very slight resistance\n      experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space—a\n      resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in <i>some</i> degree,\n      but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by\n      the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodies is,\n      chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescence is absolute\n      density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be no yielding. An\n      ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to\n      the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the\n      ratio of its apparent unanswerability.—As regards the progress of\n      the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the\n      ether <i>or the ether through it</i>. There is no astronomical error more\n      unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the\n      comets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however rare\n      this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in\n      a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who\n      have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to\n      comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand,\n      about that which might be expected from the <i>friction</i> of the ether\n      in the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the one case, the\n      retarding force is momentary and complete within itself—in the other\n      it is endlessly accumulative.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> But in all this—in this identification of mere matter with\n      God—is there nothing of irreverence? [<i>I was forced to repeat this\n      question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning</i>.]\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Can you say <i>why</i> matter should be less reverenced than\n      mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects,\n      the very “mind” or “spirit” of the schools, so far as regards its high\n      capacities, and is, moreover, the “matter” of these schools at the same\n      time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection\n      of matter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is\n      thought?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> In general, this motion is the universal thought of the\n      universal mind. This thought creates. All created things are but the\n      thoughts of God.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You say, “in general.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, <i>matter</i>\n      is necessary.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> But you now speak of “mind” and “matter” as do the\n      metaphysicians.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes—to avoid confusion. When I say “mind,” I mean the\n      unparticled or ultimate matter; by “matter,” I intend all else.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You were saying that “for new individualities matter is\n      necessary.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create\n      individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions of the\n      divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporate\n      investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnated\n      portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion of\n      the whole is that of God.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You say that divested of the body man will be God?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> [<i>After much hesitation.</i>] I could not have said this; it\n      is an absurdity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> [<i>Referring to my notes.</i>] You <i>did</i> say that\n      “divested of corporate investiture man were God.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> And this is true. Man thus divested <i>would be</i> God—would\n      be unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested—at least\n      never <i>will be</i>—else we must imagine an action of God returning\n      upon itself—a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature.\n      Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be\n      irrevocable.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the\n      body?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> I say that he will never be bodiless.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Explain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> There are two bodies—the rudimental and the complete;\n      corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What\n      we call “death,” is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present incarnation\n      is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate,\n      immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> But of the worm’s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> <i>We</i>, certainly—but not the worm. The matter of which\n      our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that\n      body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter\n      of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which the\n      ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental\n      senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from the\n      inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as well as\n      the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate\n      life.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly\n      resembles death. How is this?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the\n      ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life\n      are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly, without organs,\n      through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Unorganized?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought\n      into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the\n      exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adapted to his\n      rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being\n      unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one—the\n      nature of the volition of God—that is to say, the motion of the\n      unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by\n      conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is <i>not</i>; but a conception\n      of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it <i>is</i>. A\n      luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether. The vibrations\n      generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar\n      ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the\n      brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.\n      The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the first\n      undulation. This is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life\n      communicates with the external world; and this external world is, to the\n      rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in\n      the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole body,\n      (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with\n      no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the\n      luminiferous; and to this ether—in unison with it—the whole\n      body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates\n      it. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must\n      attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To\n      rudimental beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until\n      fledged.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You speak of rudimental “beings.” Are there other rudimental\n      thinking beings than man?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ,\n      planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulæ, suns, nor\n      planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying <i>pabulum</i> for the\n      idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But for\n      the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there would\n      have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a distinct\n      variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all, the organs\n      vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death, or metamorphosis,\n      these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life—immortality—and\n      cognizant of all secrets but <i>the one</i>, act all things and pass\n      everywhere by mere volition:—indwelling, not the stars, which to us\n      seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly\n      deem space created—but that SPACE itself—that infinity of\n      which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows—blotting\n      them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> You say that “but for the <i>necessity</i> of the rudimental\n      life” there would have been no stars. But why this necessity?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter\n      generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple <i>unique</i>\n      law—the Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, the\n      organic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,) were\n      contrived.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> But again—why need this impediment have been produced?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> The result of law inviolate is perfection—right—negative\n      happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive\n      pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and\n      substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of\n      law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in the\n      inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient\n      analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of\n      pain. <i>Positive</i> pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one\n      point we must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been\n      never to have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganic\n      life, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of the\n      primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate\n      life in Heaven.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>P.</i> Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it\n      impossible to comprehend—“the truly <i>substantive</i> vastness of\n      infinity.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n<i>V.</i> This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic\n      conception of the term “<i>substance</i>” itself. We must not regard it as\n      a quality, but as a sentiment:—it is the perception, in thinking\n      beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many\n      things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus—many\n      things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to\n      appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings—to the\n      angels—the whole of the unparticled matter is substance—that\n      is to say, the whole of what we term “space” is to them the truest\n      substantiality;—the stars, meantime, through what we consider their\n      materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the\n      unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes the\n      organic.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I\n      observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed\n      me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I done this, than,\n      with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell back upon his\n      pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minute afterward his\n      corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow was of the coldness\n      of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long\n      pressure from Azrael’s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the\n      latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the region of\n      the shadows?\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.6\"></a>THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR</h2>\n<p>\n      Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that\n      the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would\n      have been a miracle had it not—especially under the circumstances. Through\n      the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the public,\n      at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities for\n      investigation—through our endeavors to effect this—a garbled\n      or exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of\n      many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very naturally, of a great deal\n      of disbelief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I\n      comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the\n      subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me, quite\n      suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been\n      a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:—no person had as\n      yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first,\n      whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any\n      susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any\n      existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what\n      extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be\n      arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained, but\n      these most excited my curiosity—the last in especial, from the\n      immensely important character of its consequences.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these\n      particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the\n      well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca Forensica,” and author (under the\n      nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of “Wallenstein” and\n      “Gargantua.” M. Valdemar, who has resided principally at Harlem, N.Y.,\n      since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme\n      spareness of his person—his lower limbs much resembling those of\n      John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in violent\n      contrast to the blackness of his hair—the latter, in consequence,\n      being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament was markedly\n      nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment. On two\n      or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little difficulty, but was\n      disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had\n      naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or\n      thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could\n      accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always attributed my\n      failure at these points to the disordered state of his health. For some\n      months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had\n      declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak\n      calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be\n      avoided nor regretted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of\n      course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the steady\n      philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him; and he\n      had no relatives in America who would be likely to interfere. I spoke to\n      him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise, his interest seemed\n      vividly excited. I say to my surprise, for, although he had always yielded\n      his person freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any\n      tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of that character\n      which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its\n      termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us that he would\n      send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his\n      physicians as that of his decease.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M. Valdemar\n      himself, the subjoined note:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n      M<small>Y</small> D<small>EAR</small> P——,\n    </p>\n<p>\n      You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed\n      that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have\n      hit the time very nearly.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n      V<small>ALDEMAR</small>\n</p>\n<p>\n      I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in\n      fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man’s chamber. I had not seen him\n      for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief\n      interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were\n      utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had\n      been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive.\n      The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very\n      remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of physical\n      strength. He spoke with distinctness—took some palliative medicines\n      without aid—and, when I entered the room, was occupied in penciling\n      memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by pillows.\n      Doctors D—— and F—— were in attendance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After pressing Valdemar’s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and obtained\n      from them a minute account of the patient’s condition. The left lung had\n      been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous state, and\n      was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of vitality. The right,\n      in its upper portion, was also partially, if not thoroughly, ossified,\n      while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running\n      one into another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one\n      point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These appearances\n      in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date. The ossification had\n      proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a\n      month before, and the adhesion had only been observed during the three\n      previous days. Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of\n      aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an\n      exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.\n      Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was then\n      seven o’clock on Saturday evening.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On quitting the invalid’s bed-side to hold conversation with myself,\n      Doctors D—— and F—— had bidden him a final\n      farewell. It had not been their intention to return; but, at my request,\n      they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject of his\n      approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the experiment\n      proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to\n      have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male and a female\n      nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty\n      to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than\n      these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove. I therefore\n      postponed operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of\n      a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L—l,)\n      relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been my design, originally,\n      to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the\n      urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I\n      had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. L—l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take\n      notes of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now\n      have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient’s hand, I\n      begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L—l, whether\n      he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of\n      mesmerizing him in his then condition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, “Yes, I wish to be. I fear\n      you have mesmerized”—adding immediately afterwards: “I\n      fear you have deferred it too long.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found most\n      effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the first\n      lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I exerted all\n      my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes\n      after ten o’clock, when Doctors D—— and F—— called, according to\n      appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as\n      they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was already in the\n      death agony, I proceeded without hesitation—exchanging, however, the\n      lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely into the\n      right eye of the sufferer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous,\n      and at intervals of half a minute.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the\n      expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep sigh\n      escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing ceased—that\n      is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the intervals were\n      undiminished. The patient’s extremities were of an icy coldness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the\n      mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that\n      expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in\n      cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake. With a\n      few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient sleep,\n      and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not satisfied,\n      however, with this, but continued the manipulations vigorously, and with\n      the fullest exertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the\n      limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy position.\n      The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so, and reposed on the\n      bed at a moderate distance from the loin. The head was very slightly\n      elevated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the\n      gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar’s condition. After a few\n      experiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of\n      mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited.\n      Dr. D—— resolved at once to remain with the patient all night,\n      while Dr. F—— took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.\n      Mr. L—l and the nurses remained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o’clock in the\n      morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same\n      condition as when Dr. F—— went away—that is to say, he lay in\n      the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle\n      (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the\n      lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as\n      cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of\n      death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence his\n      right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to and fro\n      above his person. In such experiments with this patient, I had never\n      perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of\n      succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although\n      feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to\n      hazard a few words of conversation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “M. Valdemar,” I said, “are you asleep?” He made no answer, but I\n      perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the\n      question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was\n      agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so\n      far as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and\n      from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes;—asleep now. Do not wake me!—let me die so!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm, as\n      before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker\n      again:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “No pain—I am dying.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and nothing\n      more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F——, who came a little\n      before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the\n      patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the\n      lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so, saying:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the\n      interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak. At\n      my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost\n      inaudibly:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes; still asleep—dying.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M.\n      Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present\n      apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene—and\n      this, it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I\n      concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my\n      previous question.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the\n      sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils\n      disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,\n      resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic\n      spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each\n      cheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the suddenness of\n      their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of\n      a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time, writhed\n      itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered completely;\n      while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely\n      extended, and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue. I\n      presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to\n      death-bed horrors; but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of\n      M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back from\n      the region of the bed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every\n      reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,\n      however, simply to proceed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and\n      concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the\n      nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue. This\n      continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period, there\n      issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice—such as it\n      would be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or\n      three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I\n      might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;\n      but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no\n      similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two\n      particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might\n      fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation—as well adapted\n      to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the\n      voice seemed to reach our ears—at least mine—from a vast\n      distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place,\n      it impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself\n      comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of\n      touch.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have spoken both of “sound” and of “voice.” I mean to say that the sound\n      was one of distinct—of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct—syllabification.\n      M. Valdemar spoke—obviously in reply to the question I had\n      propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him, it will be\n      remembered, if he still slept. He now said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes;—no;—I have been sleeping—and now—now—I\n      am dead.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the\n      unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were\n      so well calculated to convey. Mr. L—l (the student) swooned. The\n      nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return.\n      My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the\n      reader. For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently—without\n      the utterance of a word—in endeavors to revive Mr. L—l. When\n      he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M.\n      Valdemar’s condition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the\n      exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An\n      attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, that\n      this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to make\n      it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication, indeed, of\n      the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the\n      tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be\n      making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition. To\n      queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly\n      insensible—although I endeavored to place each member of the company\n      in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now related all that\n      is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker’s state at this epoch.\n      Other nurses were procured; and at ten o’clock I left the house in company\n      with the two physicians and Mr. L—l.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition\n      remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the\n      propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty\n      in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It was\n      evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been\n      arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken\n      M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy,\n      dissolution.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From this period until the close of last week—an interval of nearly\n      seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar’s\n      house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this\n      time the sleeper-waker remained <i>exactly</i> as I have last described him. The\n      nurses’ attentions were continual.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of\n      awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate\n      result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much\n      discussion in private circles—to so much of what I cannot help\n      thinking unwarranted popular feeling.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I made\n      use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful. The\n      first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris.\n      It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil\n      was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from\n      beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient’s arm,\n      as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F—— then intimated a\n      desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the\n      tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the\n      jaws and lips remained rigid as before), and at length the same hideous\n      voice which I have already described, broke forth:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “For God’s sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or,\n      quick!—waken me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to\n      do. At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient; but, failing in\n      this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as\n      earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that I\n      should be successful—or at least I soon fancied that my success\n      would be complete—and I am sure that all in the room were prepared\n      to see the patient awaken.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human\n      being could have been prepared.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of “dead! dead!”\n       absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer,\n      his whole frame at once—within the space of a single minute, or even\n      less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.\n      Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of\n      loathsome—of detestable putrescence.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.7\"></a>THE BLACK CAT.</h2>\n<p>\n      For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I\n      neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in\n      a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not—and\n      very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would\n      unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world,\n      plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household\n      events. In their consequences, these events have terrified—have\n      tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them.\n      To me, they have presented little but horror—to many they will seem\n      less terrible than <i>barroques</i>. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect\n      may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place—some\n      intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own,\n      which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more\n      than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my\n      disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me\n      the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was\n      indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent\n      most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing\n      them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my\n      manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To\n      those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I\n      need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of\n      the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and\n      self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him\n      who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer\n      fidelity of mere <i>Man</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not\n      uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she\n      lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had\n      birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and <i>a cat</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,\n      and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,\n      my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made\n      frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black\n      cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever <i>serious</i> upon\n      this point—and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than\n      that it happens, just now, to be remembered.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet and\n      playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the\n      house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following\n      me through the streets.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my\n      general temperament and character—through the instrumentality of the\n      Fiend Intemperance—had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical\n      alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable,\n      more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use\n      intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal\n      violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my\n      disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however,\n      I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as\n      I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog,\n      when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way. But my\n      disease grew upon me—for what disease is like Alcohol!—and at\n      length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat\n      peevish—even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about\n      town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in\n      his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with\n      his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no\n      longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body\n      and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre\n      of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it,\n      grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes\n      from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable\n      atrocity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When reason returned with the morning—when I had slept off the fumes\n      of the night’s debauch—I experienced a sentiment half of horror,\n      half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at\n      best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I\n      again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the\n      deed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye\n      presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared\n      to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be\n      expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my old\n      heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part\n      of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave\n      place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable\n      overthrow, the spirit of P<small>ERVERSENESS</small>. Of this spirit\n      philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,\n      than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human\n      heart—one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,\n      which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred\n      times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other\n      reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual\n      inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is\n      <i>Law</i>, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of\n      perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable\n      longing of the soul <i>to vex itself</i>—to offer violence to its\n      own nature—to do wrong for the wrong’s sake only—that\n      urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted\n      upon the unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose\n      about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;—hung it with the\n      tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my\n      heart;—hung it <i>because</i> I knew that it had loved me, and\n      <i>because</i> I felt it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it\n      <i>because</i> I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin—a\n      deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place\n      it—if such a thing wore possible—even beyond the reach of the\n      infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused\n      from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames. The\n      whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife, a\n      servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The\n      destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I\n      resigned myself thenceforward to despair.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and\n      effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain\n      of facts—and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On\n      the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one\n      exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment wall,\n      not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against\n      which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great\n      measure, resisted the action of the fire—a fact which I attributed\n      to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were\n      collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of\n      it with very minute and eager attention. The words “strange!” “singular!”\n       and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. I approached and saw,\n      as if graven in <i>bas relief</i> upon the white surface, the figure of a\n      gigantic <i>cat</i>. The impression was given with an accuracy truly\n      marvellous. There was a rope about the animal’s neck.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard it\n      as less—my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length\n      reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a\n      garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been\n      immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of whom the animal must\n      have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my\n      chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from\n      sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty\n      into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with\n      the flames, and the <i>ammonia</i> from the carcass, had then accomplished\n      the portraiture as I saw it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my\n      conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail\n      to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself\n      of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into\n      my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so\n      far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the\n      vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same\n      species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its\n      place.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my\n      attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head\n      of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum, which constituted the\n      chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking steadily at the top\n      of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the\n      fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached\n      it, and touched it with my hand. It was a black cat—a very large one—fully\n      as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one.\n      Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had\n      a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole\n      region of the breast. Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred\n      loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice.\n      This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search. I at once\n      offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to\n      it—knew nothing of it—had never seen it before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal\n      evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;\n      occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached the\n      house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great\n      favorite with my wife.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This was\n      just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but—I know not how or\n      why it was—its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and\n      annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose\n      into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense of\n      shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me\n      from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or\n      otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually—very gradually—I\n      came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from\n      its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the\n      morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been\n      deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared it\n      to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that\n      humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the\n      source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed to\n      increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be\n      difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would crouch\n      beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome\n      caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly\n      throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress,\n      clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to\n      destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly by a\n      memory of my former crime, but chiefly—let me confess it at once—by\n      absolute dread of the beast.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil—and yet I should\n      be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own—yes,\n      even in this felon’s cell, I am almost ashamed to own—that the\n      terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened\n      by one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife\n      had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of\n      white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible\n      difference between the strange beast and the one I had destroyed. The\n      reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally\n      very indefinite; but, by slow degrees—degrees nearly imperceptible,\n      and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fanciful—it\n      had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the\n      representation of an object that I shudder to name—and for this,\n      above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the\n      monster <i>had I dared</i>—it was now, I say, the image of a hideous—of\n      a ghastly thing—of the GALLOWS!—oh, mournful and terrible\n      engine of Horror and of Crime—of Agony and of Death!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.\n      And <i>a brute beast </i>—whose fellow I had contemptuously\n      destroyed—<i>a brute beast</i> to work out for <i>me</i>—for\n      me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God—so much of\n      insufferable woe! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of\n      rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment alone,\n      and in the latter I started hourly from dreams of unutterable fear to\n      find the hot breath of <i>the thing</i> upon my face, and its vast weight—an\n      incarnate nightmare that I had no power to shake off—incumbent\n      eternally upon my <i>heart!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the\n      good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole intimates—the\n      darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my usual temper\n      increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the\n      sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now\n      blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas, was the most usual\n      and the most patient of sufferers.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of\n      the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat\n      followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,\n      exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath,\n      the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at\n      the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it\n      descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.\n      Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew\n      my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She fell dead upon\n      the spot, without a groan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire\n      deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I could not\n      remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of\n      being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered my mind. At one\n      period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and\n      destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in\n      the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well\n      in the yard—about packing it in a box, as if merchandise, with the\n      usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.\n      Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of\n      these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar—as the monks of the\n      middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were\n      loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough\n      plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from\n      hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a\n      false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble\n      the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the\n      bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before,\n      so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in this calculation\n      I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks,\n      and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped\n      it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole\n      structure as it originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair,\n      with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be\n      distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the\n      new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right.\n      The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been\n      disturbed. The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care.\n      I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself: “Here at least,\n      then, my labor has not been in vain.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much\n      wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death.\n      Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no\n      doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed\n      at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my\n      present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the\n      blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature\n      occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the night; and\n      thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I\n      soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder\n      upon my soul!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not. Once\n      again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the\n      premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme!\n      The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries had\n      been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had been\n      instituted—but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon\n      my future felicity as secured.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very\n      unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous\n      investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of\n      my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers\n      bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner\n      unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into\n      the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of\n      one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I\n      folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police\n      were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart was\n      too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by way of\n      triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Gentlemen,” I said at last, as the party ascended the steps,\n      “I delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health,\n      and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this—this is a\n      very well-constructed house.” (In the rabid desire to say something\n      easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)—“I may say an\n      <i>excellently</i> well-constructed house. These walls—are you\n      going, gentlemen?—these walls are solidly put together;” and\n      here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane\n      which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind\n      which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No\n      sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was\n      answered by a voice from within the tomb!—by a cry, at first muffled\n      and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into\n      one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman—a\n      howl—a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as\n      might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the\n      damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to the\n      opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained\n      motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen\n      stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already\n      greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the\n      spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of\n      fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and\n      whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the\n      monster up within the tomb!\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.8\"></a>THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Son cœur est un luth suspendu;<br>\n     Sitôt qu’on le touche il résonne..\n</p>\n<p class=\"right\">\n—<i>De Béranger</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the\n      year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been\n      passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country;\n      and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within\n      view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was—but,\n      with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom\n      pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by\n      any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the\n      mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or\n      terrible. I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and\n      the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak walls—upon\n      the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a\n      few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul\n      which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the\n      after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into\n      everyday life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an\n      iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed\n      dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture\n      into aught of the sublime. What was it—I paused to think—what\n      was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It\n      was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies\n      that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the\n      unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there <i>are</i>\n      combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\n      affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations\n      beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different\n      arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the\n      picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its\n      capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my\n      horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in\n      unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down—but with a shudder\n      even more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled and inverted\n      images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and\n      eye-like windows.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn\n      of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon\n      companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting.\n      A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country—a\n      letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate nature, had\n      admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of\n      nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a\n      mental disorder which oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see\n      me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of\n      attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his\n      malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said—it\n      was the apparent <i>heart</i> that went with his request—which\n      allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what\n      I still considered a very singular summons.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew\n      little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I\n      was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out\n      of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself,\n      through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late,\n      in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a\n      passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the\n      orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had\n      learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race,\n      all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring\n      branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of\n      descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation,\n      so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in\n      thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the\n      accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the\n      possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might\n      have exercised upon the other—it was this deficiency, perhaps, of\n      collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire\n      to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so\n      identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the\n      quaint and equivocal appellation of the “House of Usher”—an\n      appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who\n      used it, both the family and the family mansion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment—that\n      of looking down within the tarn—had been to deepen the first\n      singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the\n      rapid increase of my superstition—for why should I not so term it?—served\n      mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the\n      paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might\n      have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the\n      house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange\n      fancy—a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show\n      the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon\n      my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and\n      domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate\n      vicinity—an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven,\n      but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the\n      silent tarn—a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly\n      discernible, and leaden-hued.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Shaking off from my spirit what <i>must</i> have been a dream, I scanned\n      more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature\n      seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had\n      been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine\n      tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any\n      extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and\n      there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\n      adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.\n      In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old\n      wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no\n      disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of\n      extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.\n      Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely\n      perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in\n      front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became\n      lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A\n      servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the\n      hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through\n      many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the <i>studio</i> of\n      his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not\n      how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.\n      While the objects around me—while the carvings of the ceilings, the\n      sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the\n      phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but\n      matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my\n      infancy—while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all\n      this—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which\n      ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the\n      physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled\n      expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation\n      and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the\n      presence of his master.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows\n      were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black\n      oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of\n      encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes, and served\n      to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the\n      eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the\n      chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark\n      draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,\n      comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay\n      scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that\n      I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and\n      irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at\n      full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it,\n      I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality—of the constrained\n      effort of the <i>ennuyé</i> man of the world. A glance, however, at his\n      countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for\n      some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of\n      pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so\n      brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could\n      bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the\n      companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at\n      all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large,\n      liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very\n      pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew\n      model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a\n      finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of\n      moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these\n      features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple,\n      made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in\n      the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and\n      of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I\n      doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now\n      miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me.\n      The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in\n      its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I\n      could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any\n      idea of simple humanity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence—an\n      inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and\n      futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy—an excessive\n      nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been\n      prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish\n      traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation\n      and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His\n      voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits\n      seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision—that\n      abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation—that\n      leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which\n      may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium,\n      during the periods of his most intense excitement.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire\n      to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at\n      some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It\n      was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he\n      despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous affection, he immediately\n      added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a\n      host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them,\n      interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the\n      general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a\n      morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable;\n      he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all flowers\n      were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there\n      were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did\n      not inspire him with horror.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall\n      perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and\n      not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in\n      themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even\n      the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable\n      agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its\n      absolute effect—in terror. In this unnerved—in this pitiable\n      condition—I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I\n      must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim\n      phantasm, FEAR.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints,\n      another singular feature of his mental condition. He was enchained by\n      certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he\n      tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth—in\n      regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms\n      too shadowy here to be re-stated—an influence which some\n      peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had,\n      by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit—an\n      effect which the <i>physique</i> of the gray walls and turrets, and of the\n      dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about\n      upon the <i>morale</i> of his existence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar\n      gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far\n      more palpable origin—to the severe and long-continued illness—indeed\n      to the evidently approaching dissolution—of a tenderly beloved\n      sister—his sole companion for long years—his last and only\n      relative on earth. “Her decease,” he said, with a bitterness which I can\n      never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last\n      of the ancient race of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for\n      so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the\n      apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I\n      regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread—and\n      yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of\n      stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a\n      door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and\n      eagerly the countenance of the brother—but he had buried his face in\n      his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness\n      had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many\n      passionate tears.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her\n      physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and\n      frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical\n      character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up\n      against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to\n      bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she\n      succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation)\n      to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse\n      I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should\n      obtain—that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no\n      more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or\n      myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to\n      alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I\n      listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking\n      guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more\n      unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I\n      perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which\n      darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all\n      objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of\n      gloom.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent\n      alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any\n      attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the\n      occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and\n      highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. His long\n      improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold\n      painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the\n      wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his\n      elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses\n      at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not\n      why—from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me)\n      I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should\n      lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity,\n      by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If\n      ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at\n      least—in the circumstances then surrounding me—there arose out\n      of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon\n      his canvass, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I\n      ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete\n      reveries of Fuseli.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so\n      rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although\n      feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely\n      long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and\n      without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design\n      served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding\n      depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any\n      portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of\n      light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and\n      bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which\n      rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of\n      certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow\n      limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave\n      birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.\n      But the fervid <i>facility</i> of his <i>impromptus</i> could not be so\n      accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in\n      the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied\n      himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense\n      mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded\n      as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial\n      excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered.\n      I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it,\n      because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I\n      perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of\n      Usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses,\n      which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very nearly, if not\n      accurately, thus:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.<br>\n     In the greenest of our valleys,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By good angels tenanted,<br>\n     Once a fair and stately palace—<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiant palace—reared its head.<br>\n     In the monarch Thought’s dominion—<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stood there!<br>\n     Never seraph spread a pinion<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over fabric half so fair.<br><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.<br>\n     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its roof did float and flow;<br>\n     (This—all this—was in the olden<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time long ago)<br>\n     And every gentle air that dallied,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sweet day,<br>\n     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A winged odor went away.<br><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III.<br>\n     Wanderers in that happy valley<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through two luminous windows saw<br>\n     Spirits moving musically<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a lute’s well-tunéd law,<br>\n     Round about a throne, where sitting<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Porphyrogene!)<br>\n     In state his glory well befitting,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler of the realm was seen.<br><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.<br>\n     And all with pearl and ruby glowing<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the fair palace door,<br>\n     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sparkling evermore,<br>\n     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but to sing,<br>\n     In voices of surpassing beauty,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wit and wisdom of their king.<br><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.<br>\n     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assailed the monarch’s high estate;<br>\n     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)<br>\n     And, round about his home, the glory<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blushed and bloomed<br>\n     Is but a dim-remembered story<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old time entombed.<br><br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.<br>\n     And travellers now within that valley,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the red-litten windows, see<br>\n     Vast forms that move fantastically<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a discordant melody;<br>\n     While, like a rapid ghastly river,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the pale door,<br>\n     A hideous throng rush out forever,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laugh—but smile no more.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n      I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into a\n      train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher’s which\n      I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men * have\n      thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained\n      it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all\n      vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a\n      more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the\n      kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the\n      earnest <i>abandon</i> of his persuasion. The belief, however, was\n      connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home\n      of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he\n      imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones—in\n      the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many <i>fungi</i>\n      which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around—above\n      all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its\n      reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence—the\n      evidence of the sentience—was to be seen, he said, (and I here\n      started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an\n      atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was\n      discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible\n      influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and\n      which made <i>him</i> what I now saw him—what he was. Such opinions\n      need no comment, and I will make none.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      * Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.—See\n      “Chemical Essays,” vol v.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of\n      the mental existence of the invalid—were, as might be supposed, in\n      strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over\n      such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of\n      Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of\n      Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean\n      D’Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of\n      Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a\n      small octavo edition of the <i>Directorium Inquisitorium</i>, by the\n      Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,\n      about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit\n      dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal\n      of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic—the manual\n      of a forgotten church—the <i>Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum\n      Ecclesiae Maguntinae</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its\n      probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having\n      informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his\n      intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its\n      final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of\n      the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular\n      proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The\n      brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of\n      the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive\n      and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and\n      exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that\n      when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met\n      upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire\n      to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an\n      unnatural, precaution.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for\n      the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone\n      bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been\n      so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive\n      atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp,\n      and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth,\n      immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own\n      sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times,\n      for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of\n      deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a\n      portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through\n      which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of\n      massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight\n      caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of\n      horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and\n      looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the\n      brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining,\n      perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned\n      that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a\n      scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,\n      however, rested not long upon the dead—for we could not regard her\n      unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of\n      youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical\n      character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and\n      that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in\n      death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door\n      of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments\n      of the upper portion of the house.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change\n      came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary\n      manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.\n      He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless\n      step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more\n      ghastly hue—but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.\n      The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a\n      tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his\n      utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly\n      agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which\n      he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to\n      resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld\n      him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest\n      attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that\n      his condition terrified—that it infected me. I felt creeping upon\n      me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic\n      yet impressive superstitions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh\n      or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon,\n      that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my\n      couch—while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason\n      off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to believe\n      that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence\n      of the gloomy furniture of the room—of the dark and tattered\n      draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest,\n      swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the\n      decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible\n      tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very\n      heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp\n      and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly\n      within the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened—I know not why,\n      except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to certain low and\n      indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long\n      intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of\n      horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste\n      (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavored\n      to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by\n      pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an\n      adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as\n      that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at\n      my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\n      cadaverously wan—but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity\n      in his eyes—an evidently restrained <i>hysteria</i> in his whole\n      demeanor. His air appalled me—but anything was preferable to the\n      solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as\n      a relief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about\n      him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen it?—but,\n      stay! you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he\n      hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It\n      was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly\n      singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently\n      collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent\n      alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the\n      clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did\n      not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew\n      careering from all points against each other, without passing away into\n      the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our\n      perceiving this—yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars—nor\n      was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of\n      the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects\n      immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly\n      luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and\n      enshrouded the mansion.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You must not—you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly, to\n      Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.\n      “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena\n      not uncommon—or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the\n      rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;—the air is\n      chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite\n      romances. I will read, and you shall listen;—and so we will pass\n      away this terrible night together.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      The antique volume which I had taken up was the “Mad Trist” of Sir\n      Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher’s more in sad\n      jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and\n      unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and\n      spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book\n      immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which\n      now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of\n      mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of\n      the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild\n      overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently\n      harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself\n      upon the success of my design.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the\n      hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the\n      dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here,\n      it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now\n      mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had\n      drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth,\n      was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his\n      shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace\n      outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door\n      for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so\n      cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and\n      hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused;\n      for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy\n      had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from some very remote\n      portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might\n      have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled\n      and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir\n      Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the\n      coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling\n      of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the\n      still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which\n      should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore\n      enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in\n      the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a\n      fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of\n      silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this\n      legend enwritten—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;<br>\n     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\n</p>\n<p>\n      And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,\n      which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so\n      horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close\n      his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof\n      was never before heard.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement—for\n      there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually\n      hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to\n      say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual\n      screaming or grating sound—the exact counterpart of what my fancy\n      had already conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by\n      the romancer.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most\n      extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which\n      wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient\n      presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive\n      nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed\n      the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had,\n      during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a position\n      fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit\n      with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially\n      perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were\n      murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast—yet I knew\n      that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I\n      caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at\n      variance with this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a\n      gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all\n      this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the\n      dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of\n      the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way\n      before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the\n      castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not\n      for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with\n      a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a shield of\n      brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver—I\n      became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet\n      apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to my\n      feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed\n      to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and\n      throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I\n      placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his\n      whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he\n      spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my\n      presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous\n      import of his words.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and <i>have</i> heard it. Long—long—long—many\n      minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh,\n      pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—I dared not—I <i>dared</i>\n      not speak! <i>We have put her living in the tomb!</i> Said I not that my\n      senses were acute? I <i>now</i> tell you that I heard her first feeble\n      movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them—many, many days ago—yet\n      I dared not—<i>I dared not speak!</i> And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha!\n      ha!—the breaking of the hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the\n      dragon, and the clangor of the shield!—say, rather, the rending of\n      her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her\n      struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I\n      fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my\n      haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish\n      that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? Madman!”—here he\n      sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the\n      effort he were giving up his soul—“<i>Madman! I tell you that she\n      now stands without the door!</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the\n      potency of a spell—the huge antique pannels to which the speaker\n      pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony\n      jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust—but then without those\n      doors there <i>did</i> stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady\n      Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence\n      of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a\n      moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold—then,\n      with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her\n      brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the\n      floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was\n      still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.\n      Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see\n      whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its\n      shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting,\n      and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once\n      barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending\n      from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While I\n      gazed, this fissure rapidly widened—there came a fierce breath of\n      the whirlwind—the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my\n      sight—my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder—there\n      was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters—and\n      the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the\n      fragments of the “<i>House of Usher</i>.”\n     </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.9\"></a>SILENCE—A FABLE</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     “The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves <i>are\n     silent</i>.”\n</p>\n<p>\n      “Listen to me,” said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. “The\n      region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of the\n      river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow not\n      onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye\n      of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles on\n      either side of the river’s oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic\n      water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch\n      towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their\n      everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from\n      among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto\n      the other.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of the dark,\n      horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low\n      underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout the\n      heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with\n      a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one by one, drop\n      everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing\n      in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the\n      gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the\n      fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And\n      by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither quiet nor silence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having\n      fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and the\n      rain fell upon my head—and the lilies sighed one unto the other in\n      the solemnity of their desolation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was\n      crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by\n      the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon. And the\n      rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,—and the rock was gray. Upon\n      its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through the\n      morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might\n      read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher them. And I\n      was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and\n      I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the characters, and\n      the characters were <small>DESOLATION</small>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock;\n      and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the actions\n      of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up\n      from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the outlines\n      of his figure were indistinct—but his features were the features of\n      a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon,\n      and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow\n      was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the few\n      furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and\n      disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and\n      looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet\n      shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the\n      rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within shelter\n      of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled\n      in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the\n      dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale\n      legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of the\n      water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I lay\n      close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man\n      trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and he sat upon the\n      rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among\n      the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt\n      among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my\n      call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared\n      loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert\n      and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but\n      the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful\n      tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind. And\n      the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest—and the\n      rain beat upon the head of the man—and the floods of the river came\n      down—and the river was tormented into foam—and the\n      water-lilies shrieked within their beds—and the forest crumbled\n      before the wind—and the thunder rolled—and the lightning fell—and\n      the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within my covert and\n      observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but\n      the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and\n      the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder,\n      and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed, and were\n      still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven—and\n      the thunder died away—and the lightning did not flash—and the\n      clouds hung motionless—and the waters sunk to their level and\n      remained—and the trees ceased to rock—and the water-lilies\n      sighed no more—and the murmur was heard no longer from among them,\n      nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I\n      looked upon the characters of the rock, and they were changed; and\n      the characters were <small>SILENCE</small>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance\n      was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and\n      stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice throughout\n      the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock were\n      <small>SILENCE</small>. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar\n      off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.”\n     </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in the\n      iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious\n      histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea—and\n      of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven.\n      There was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and\n      holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around\n      Dodona—but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as\n      he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most\n      wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back\n      within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh with the\n      Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx which\n      dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet\n      of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.10\"></a>THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.</h2>\n<p>\n      The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever\n      been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the\n      redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden\n      dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The\n      scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,\n      were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of\n      his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the\n      disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his\n      dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand\n      hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his\n      court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his\n      castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the\n      creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and\n      lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,\n      having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.\n      They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden\n      impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply\n      provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to\n      contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime\n      it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the\n      appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,\n      there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there\n      was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the “Red Death.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and\n      while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero\n      entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual\n      magnificence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the\n      rooms in which it was held. There were seven—an imperial suite. In\n      many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while\n      the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that\n      the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very\n      different; as might have been expected from the duke’s love of the\n      bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision\n      embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at\n      every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the\n      right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic\n      window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the\n      suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in\n      accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into\n      which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in\n      blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was\n      purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple.\n      The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was\n      furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the\n      sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black\n      velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,\n      falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in\n      this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the\n      decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood color. Now in\n      no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the\n      profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended\n      from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or\n      candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed\n      the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a\n      brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so\n      glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy\n      and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect\n      of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the\n      blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a\n      look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of\n      the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall,\n      a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull,\n      heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the\n      face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of\n      the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly\n      musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an\n      hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,\n      momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the\n      waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief\n      disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock\n      yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged\n      and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie\n      or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at\n      once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled\n      as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each\n      to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no\n      similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which\n      embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies),\n      there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same\n      disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The\n      tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and\n      effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold\n      and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some\n      who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was\n      necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven\n      chambers, upon occasion of this great fête; and it was his own guiding\n      taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were\n      grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm—much\n      of what has been since seen in “Hernani.” There were arabesque figures\n      with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as\n      the madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton,\n      much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that\n      which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there\n      stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these—the dreams—writhed\n      in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the\n      orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the\n      ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a\n      moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The\n      dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die\n      away—they have endured but an instant—and a light,\n      half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the\n      music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than\n      ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the\n      rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of\n      the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is\n      waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored\n      panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose\n      foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony\n      a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears\n      who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\n      feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at\n      length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then\n      the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were\n      quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But\n      now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and\n      thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,\n      into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus,\n      too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime\n      had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd\n      who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure\n      which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the\n      rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there\n      arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of\n      disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror, and\n      of disgust.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be\n      supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In\n      truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the\n      figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of\n      even the prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of\n      the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the\n      utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters\n      of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply\n      to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor\n      propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head\n      to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the\n      visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened\n      corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the\n      cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the\n      mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type\n      of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad\n      brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet\n      horror.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with\n      a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked\n      to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first\n      moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the\n      next, his brow reddened with rage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Who dares?” he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him—“who\n      dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him—that\n      we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero\n      as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and\n      clearly—for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had\n      become hushed at the waving of his hand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale\n      courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing\n      movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment\n      was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made\n      closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which\n      the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were\n      found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed\n      within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if\n      with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he\n      made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step\n      which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to\n      the purple—through the purple to the green—through the green\n      to the orange—through this again to the white—and even thence\n      to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was\n      then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame\n      of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers,\n      while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon\n      all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid\n      impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when\n      the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned\n      suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the\n      dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly\n      afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning\n      the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw\n      themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall\n      figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock,\n      gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and\n      corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted\n      by any tangible form.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come like a\n      thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the\n      blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\n      posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of\n      the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness\n      and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.11\"></a>THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.</h2>\n<p>\n      The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when\n      he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature\n      of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat.\n      <i>At length</i> I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled—but\n      the very definitiveness with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of\n      risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is\n      unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally\n      unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who\n      has done the wrong.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato\n      cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his\n      face, and he did not perceive that my smile <i>now</i> was at the thought\n      of his immolation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in other regards\n      he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his\n      connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For\n      the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity—to\n      practise imposture upon the British and Austrian <i>millionaires</i>. In\n      painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack—but\n      in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not\n      differ from him materially: I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself,\n      and bought largely whenever I could.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival\n      season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive\n      warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a\n      tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the\n      conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I\n      should never have done wringing his hand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I said to him: “My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How\n      remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what\n      passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the\n      carnival!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the full\n      Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be\n      found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Amontillado!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have my doubts.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Amontillado!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And I must satisfy them.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Amontillado!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical\n      turn, it is he. He will tell me—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Come, let us go.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Whither?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “To your vaults.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you\n      have an engagement. Luchesi—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have no engagement;—come.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I\n      perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are\n      encrusted with nitre.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You\n      have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry\n      from Amontillado.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of\n      black silk, and drawing a <i>roquelaire</i> closely about my person, I\n      suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in\n      honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the\n      morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.\n      These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate\n      disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,\n      bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the\n      vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be\n      cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and\n      stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as\n      he strode.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The pipe,” said he.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white web-work which gleams\n      from these cavern walls.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\n      distilled the rheum of intoxication.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nitre?” he asked, at length.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Nitre,” I replied. “How long have you had that cough?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh!\n      ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is nothing,” he said, at last.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is precious.\n      You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.\n      You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you\n      will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I\n      shall not die of a cough.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “True—true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming\n      you unnecessarily—but you should use all proper caution. A draught\n      of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of\n      its fellows that lay upon the mould.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me\n      familiarly, while his bells jingled.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And I to your long life.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      He again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and numerous family.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I forget your arms.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent\n      rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And the motto?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i>.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Good!” he said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew\n      warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with\n      casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the\n      catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by\n      an arm above the elbow.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The nitre!” I said: “see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the\n      vaults. We are below the river’s bed. The drops of moisture trickle among\n      the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. But first, another draught of the\n      Medoc.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He emptied it at a breath.\n      His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle\n      upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement—a grotesque\n      one.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You do not comprehend?” he said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Not I,” I replied.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Then you are not of the brotherhood.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “How?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You are not of the masons.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes, yes,” I said, “yes, yes.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “You? Impossible! A mason?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “A mason,” I replied.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “A sign,” he said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “It is this,” I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my\n      <i>roquelaire</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “But let us proceed to\n      the Amontillado.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again\n      offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in\n      search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,\n      descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in\n      which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than\n      flame.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.\n      Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead,\n      in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this\n      interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the\n      bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming\n      at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the\n      displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth\n      about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have\n      been constructed for no especial use in itself, but formed merely the\n      interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the\n      catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid\n      granite.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to pry\n      into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not\n      enable us to see.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi—”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\n      forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had\n      reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by\n      the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him\n      to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each\n      other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short\n      chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it\n      was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded\n      to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\n      nitre. Indeed it is <i>very</i> damp. Once more let me <i>implore</i> you\n      to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render\n      you all the little attentions in my power.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The Amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\n      astonishment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I\n      have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of\n      building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my\n      trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered that\n      the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\n      earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of\n      the recess. It was <i>not</i> the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\n      long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the\n      fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise\n      lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with\n      the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones.\n      When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished\n      without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall\n      was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding\n      the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure\n      within.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat\n      of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief\n      moment I hesitated—I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to\n      grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured\n      me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt\n      satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who\n      clamored. I re-echoed—I aided—I surpassed them in volume and\n      in strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed\n      the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the\n      last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and\n      plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its\n      destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that\n      erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I\n      had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice\n      said—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he!—a very good joke indeed—an\n      excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo—he!\n      he! he!—over our wine—he! he! he!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “The Amontillado!” I said.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “He! he! he!—he! he! he!—yes, the Amontillado. But is it not\n      getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady\n      Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” I said, “let us be gone.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “<i>For the love of God, Montressor!</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Yes,” I said, “for the love of God!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I\n      called aloud—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Fortunato!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      No answer. I called again—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Fortunato!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let\n      it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.\n      My heart grew sick—on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I\n      hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its\n      position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old\n      rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.\n      <i>In pace requiescat!</i>\n</p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.12\"></a>THE IMP OF THE PERVERSE</h2>\n<p>\n      In the consideration of the faculties and impulses—of the prima\n      mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for\n      a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,\n      irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists\n      who have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have all\n      overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely\n      through want of belief—of faith;—whether it be faith in\n      Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to\n      us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse—for\n      the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not\n      understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion\n      of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;—we could not have\n      understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of\n      humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology\n      and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori.\n      The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or\n      observant man, set himself to imagine designs—to dictate purposes to\n      God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah,\n      out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind. In the\n      matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough,\n      that it was the design of the Deity that man should eat. We then assigned\n      to man an organ of alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with\n      which the Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having\n      settled it to be God’s will that man should continue his species, we\n      discovered an organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness,\n      with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,—so, in short,\n      with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or\n      a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the\n      Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in\n      part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of\n      their predecessors; deducing and establishing every thing from the\n      preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his\n      Creator.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if\n      classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did,\n      and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we\n      took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend\n      God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that\n      call the works into being? If we cannot understand him in his objective\n      creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Induction, <i>a posteriori</i>, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an\n      innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something,\n      which we may call <i>perverseness</i>, for want of a more characteristic term. In\n      the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a <i>mobile</i> without motive, a motive not\n      <i>motivirt</i>. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or,\n      if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far\n      modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for\n      the reason that we should <i>not</i>. In theory, no reason can be more\n      unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain minds,\n      under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. I am not\n      more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error\n      of any action is often the one unconquerable <i>force</i> which impels us, and\n      alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to\n      do wrong for the wrong’s sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into\n      ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive impulse—elementary. It\n      will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we\n      should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that\n      which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a\n      glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness\n      has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard\n      against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire\n      to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. It follows,\n      that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any\n      principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in\n      the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be\n      well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment\n      exists.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An appeal to one’s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the\n      sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly\n      questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of\n      the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than\n      distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented,\n      for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by\n      circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every\n      intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear; the most\n      laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue;\n      it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow;\n      he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the\n      thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this\n      anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough. The impulse\n      increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable\n      longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the\n      speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it\n      will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life\n      calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are\n      consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of\n      whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be\n      undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why? There\n      is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no\n      comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more\n      impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety\n      arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable,\n      craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly. The\n      last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of the\n      conflict within us,—of the definite with the indefinite—of the\n      substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it\n      is the shadow which prevails,—we struggle in vain. The clock\n      strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the\n      chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It flies—it\n      disappears—we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor now.\n      Alas, it is too late!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss—we\n      grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.\n      Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and\n      horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations, still\n      more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the\n      bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of\n      this our cloud upon the precipice’s edge, there grows into palpability, a\n      shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet\n      it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very\n      marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It\n      is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping\n      precipitancy of a fall from such a height. And this fall—this\n      rushing annihilation—for the very reason that it involves that one\n      most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of\n      death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our\n      imagination—for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire\n      it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore\n      do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so\n      demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a\n      precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any\n      attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us\n      to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no\n      friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate\n      ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting\n      solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we feel\n      that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible\n      principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct\n      instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate\n      in furtherance of good.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your\n      question—that I may explain to you why I am here—that I may\n      assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a\n      cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the\n      condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have\n      misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As\n      it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted\n      victims of the Imp of the Perverse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more\n      thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of\n      the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment\n      involved a <i>chance</i> of detection. At length, in reading some French memoirs,\n      I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame\n      Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. The idea\n      struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim’s habit of reading in bed. I\n      knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated. But I need\n      not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy\n      artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a\n      wax-light of my own making for the one which I there found. The next\n      morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the coroner’s verdict was—“Death\n      by the visitation of God.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of\n      detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I\n      had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew by which it\n      would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is\n      inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I\n      reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was\n      accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight\n      than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there\n      arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by\n      scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It\n      harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an\n      instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in\n      our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song,\n      or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. Nor will we be the less\n      tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious. In\n      this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my\n      security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act\n      of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of\n      petulance, I remodelled them thus: “I am safe—I am safe—yes—if\n      I be not fool enough to make open confession!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to my\n      heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity (whose\n      nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that\n      in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own\n      casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the\n      murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of\n      him whom I had murdered—and beckoned me on to death.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul. I\n      walked vigorously—faster—still faster—at length I ran. I\n      felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought\n      overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood\n      that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace.\n      I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. At length, the\n      populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the consummation of\n      my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a\n      rough voice resounded in my ears—a rougher grasp seized me by the\n      shoulder. I turned—I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced\n      all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and\n      then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad palm upon\n      the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked\n      emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before\n      concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the\n      hangman and to hell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction,\n      I fell prostrate in a swoon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But why shall I say more?

      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.13\"></a>THE ISLAND OF THE FAY</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nNullus enim locus sine genio est.—<i>Servius</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\n      “La musique,” says Marmontel, in those “Contes Moraux” (*1) which in all\n      our translations, we have insisted upon calling “Moral Tales,” as if in\n      mockery of their spirit—“la musique est le seul des talents qui\n      jouissent de lui-même; tous les autres veulent des temoins.” He here\n      confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for\n      creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music\n      susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to\n      appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that\n      it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which\n      the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in\n      its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very\n      tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly\n      estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition, in this form,\n      will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and\n      for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach\n      of fallen mortality and perhaps only one—which owes even more than\n      does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness\n      experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who\n      would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold\n      that glory. To me, at least, the presence—not of human life only,\n      but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow\n      upon the soil and are voiceless—is a stain upon the landscape—is\n      at war with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark\n      valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the\n      forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains\n      that look down upon all,—I love to regard these as themselves but\n      the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole—a whole\n      whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of\n      all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the\n      moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose\n      thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies\n      are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own\n      cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain—a being which\n      we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the\n      same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand—notwithstanding\n      the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood—that space, and\n      therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the\n      Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for\n      the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of\n      bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given\n      surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter;—while\n      the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser\n      population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise\n      arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God,\n      that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to\n      fill it. And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with\n      vitality is a principle—indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the\n      leading principle in the operations of Deity,—it is scarcely logical\n      to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace\n      it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within\n      cycle without end,—yet all revolving around one far-distant centre\n      which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner,\n      life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit\n      Divine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing\n      man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in\n      the universe than that vast “clod of the valley” which he tills and\n      contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than\n      that he does not behold it in operation. (*2)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations\n      among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge\n      of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My wanderings\n      amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary;\n      and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim, deep\n      valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been\n      an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed\n      alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion to the\n      well-known work of Zimmerman, that, “la solitude est une belle chose; mais\n      il faut quelqu’un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose?” The\n      epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a thing that does not\n      exist.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of\n      mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn\n      writhing or sleeping within all—that I chanced upon a certain\n      rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw\n      myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,\n      that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only\n      should I look upon it—such was the character of phantasm which it\n      wore.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On all sides—save to the west, where the sun was about sinking—arose\n      the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply in\n      its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit\n      from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees\n      to the east—while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I\n      lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and\n      continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the\n      sunset fountains of the sky.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one small\n      circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n      So blended bank and shadow there<br>\n      That each seemed pendulous in air—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say\n      at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion\n      began.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and\n      western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked\n      difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of\n      garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant\n      sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short, springy,\n      sweet-scented, and asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful,\n      erect—bright, slender, and graceful,—of Eastern figure and\n      foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a deep\n      sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out the\n      heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and\n      fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips\n      with wings. (*4)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade. A\n      sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things. The\n      trees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing\n      themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of\n      mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the\n      cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and\n      thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and\n      not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over\n      and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade of the\n      trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein,\n      impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied that each\n      shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly\n      from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream;\n      while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of\n      their predecessors thus entombed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I\n      lost myself forthwith in revery. “If ever island were enchanted,” said I\n      to myself, “this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who\n      remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?—or\n      do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In\n      dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God,\n      little by little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after\n      shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree\n      is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it\n      preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to rest,\n      and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon\n      their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the\n      sycamore—flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a\n      quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased—while I\n      thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays\n      about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from\n      out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in a\n      singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar.\n      While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed\n      indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the\n      shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and\n      re-entered the region of light. “The revolution which has just been made\n      by the Fay,” continued I, musingly, “is the cycle of the brief year of her\n      life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a\n      year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came into\n      the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the dark\n      water, making its blackness more black.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      And again the boat appeared and the Fay; but about the attitude of the\n      latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy. She\n      floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened\n      momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and\n      became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the\n      circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at\n      each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while\n      it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage\n      into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in\n      a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had utterly departed, the\n      Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her\n      boat into the region of the ebony flood—and that she issued thence at all\n      I cannot say, for darkness fell over all things and I beheld her magical\n      figure no more.\n    </p>\n",

Again in\n      fancy I behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before\n      me!—not—oh! not as thou art—in the cold valley and\n      shadow—but as thou <i>shouldst be</i>—squandering away a life\n      of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own\n      Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide\n      windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter\n      meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I repeat it—as\n      thou <i>shouldst be</i>. There are surely other worlds than\n      this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude—other\n      speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall call\n      thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or\n      denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the\n      overflowings of thine everlasting energies?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the <i>Ponte di\n      Sospiri</i>, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom I\n      speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind the\n      circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember—ah! how should I\n      forget?—the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,\n      and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had sounded\n      the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the Campanile lay\n      silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal Palace were dying\n      fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, by way of the Grand\n      Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal San\n      Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in\n      one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at the sound, I\n      sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip his single oar,\n      lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery, and we were\n      consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the\n      greater into the smaller channel. Like some huge and sable-feathered\n      condor, we were slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a\n      thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of\n      the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and\n      preternatural day.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an\n      upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The quiet\n      waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my own gondola\n      was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the stream,\n      was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which was to be found,\n      alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the\n      entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a figure\n      which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten. It was the Marchesa\n      Aphrodite—the adoration of all Venice—the gayest of the gay—the\n      most lovely where all were beautiful—but still the young wife of the\n      old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of that fair child, her first\n      and only one, who now, deep beneath the murky water, was thinking in\n      bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses, and exhausting its little\n      life in struggles to call upon her name.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the black\n      mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than half loosened\n      for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amid a shower of\n      diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls like those of the\n      young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly\n      the sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer and midnight\n      air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like form\n      itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung\n      around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe. Yet—strange to\n      say!—her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that\n      grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried—but riveted in a widely\n      different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think, the\n      stateliest building in all Venice—but how could that lady gaze so\n      fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark,\n      gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window—what,\n      then, <i>could</i> there be in its shadows—in its architecture—in\n      its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices—that the Marchesa di Mentoni\n      had not wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!—Who does not\n      remember that, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,\n      multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off\n      places, the woe which is close at hand?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,\n      stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was\n      occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed <i>ennuye</i> to\n      the very death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his\n      child. Stupefied and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the\n      upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must\n      have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous\n      appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down among\n      them in that funereal gondola.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search were\n      relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There seemed\n      but little hope for the child; (how much less than for the mother!) but\n      now, from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned\n      as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the\n      lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak, stepped out within\n      reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy\n      descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant afterwards, he\n      stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp, upon the\n      marble flagstones by the side of the Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the\n      drenching water, became unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet,\n      discovered to the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very\n      young man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of Europe was\n      then ringing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive her\n      child—she will press it to her heart—she will cling to its\n      little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! <i>another’s</i> arms\n      have taken it from the stranger—<i>another’s</i> arms have taken it\n      away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa!\n      Her lip—her beautiful lip trembles; tears are gathering in her eyes—those\n      eyes which, like Pliny’s acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.” Yes!\n      tears are gathering in those eyes—and see! the entire woman thrills\n      throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of\n      the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very purity\n      of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of\n      ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate\n      frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the\n      grass.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Why <i>should</i> that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer—except\n      that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother’s heart, the\n      privacy of her own <i>boudoir</i>, she has neglected to enthral her tiny\n      feet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetian\n      shoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible reason\n      could there have been for her so blushing?—for the glance of those\n      wild appealing eyes?—for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?—for\n      the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?—that hand which\n      fell, as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of\n      the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low—the\n      singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered\n      hurriedly in bidding him adieu? “Thou hast conquered,” she said, or the\n      murmurs of the water deceived me; “thou hast conquered—one hour\n      after sunrise—we shall meet—so let it be!”\n     </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace, and\n      the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. He shook\n      with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in search of a\n      gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of my own; and he\n      accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we\n      proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his\n      self-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of\n      great apparent cordiality.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The\n      person of the stranger—let me call him by this title, who to all the\n      world was still a stranger—the person of the stranger is one of\n      these subjects. In height he might have been below rather than above the\n      medium size: although there were moments of intense passion when his frame\n      actually <i>expanded</i> and belied the assertion. The light, almost\n      slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity which\n      he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which\n      he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more\n      dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity—singular,\n      wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense\n      and brilliant jet—and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which\n      a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and\n      ivory—his were features than which I have seen none more classically\n      regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his\n      countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at\n      some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It had\n      no peculiar, it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened\n      upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten, but\n      forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.\n      Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to throw\n      its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face—but that the\n      mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when the passion\n      had departed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in what I\n      thought an urgent manner, to call upon him <i>very</i> early the next\n      morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his Palazzo,\n      one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower\n      above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto. I was\n      shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose\n      unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an actual glare,\n      making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his possessions\n      in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous\n      exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bring myself to believe\n      that the wealth of any subject in Europe could have supplied the princely\n      magnificence which burned and blazed around.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still brilliantly\n      lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as from an air of\n      exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he had not retired to bed\n      during the whole of the preceding night. In the architecture and\n      embellishments of the chamber, the evident design had been to dazzle and\n      astound. Little attention had been paid to the <i>decora</i> of what is\n      technically called <i>keeping</i>, or to the proprieties of nationality.\n      The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon none—neither\n      the <i>grotesques</i> of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the\n      best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich\n      draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low,\n      melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The senses were\n      oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strange\n      convolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and flickering\n      tongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun poured\n      in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane of\n      crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections, from\n      curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten silver,\n      the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the artificial\n      light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of rich,\n      liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha! ha! ha!—ha! ha! ha!”—laughed the proprietor,\n      motioning me to a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back\n      at full-length upon an ottoman. “I see,” said he, perceiving\n      that I could not immediately reconcile myself to the <i>bienseance</i> of\n      so singular a welcome—“I see you are astonished at my\n      apartment—at my statues—my pictures—my originality of\n      conception in architecture and upholstery! absolutely drunk, eh, with my\n      magnificence? But pardon me, my dear sir, (here his tone of voice dropped\n      to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon me for my uncharitable\n      laughter. You appeared so <i>utterly</i> astonished. Besides, some things\n      are so completely ludicrous, that a man <i>must</i> laugh or die. To die\n      laughing, must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas\n      More—a very fine man was Sir Thomas More—Sir Thomas More died\n      laughing, you remember. Also in the <i>Absurdities</i> of Ravisius\n      Textor, there is a long list of characters who came to the same\n      magnificent end. Do you know, however,” continued he musingly,\n      “that at Sparta (which is now Palæochori,) at Sparta, I say, to the\n      west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind\n      of <i>socle</i>, upon which are still legible the letters\n      ΛΑΞΜ. They are undoubtedly part of\n      ΓΕΛΑΞΜΑ. Now, at Sparta were a\n      thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities. How\n      exceedingly strange that the altar of Laughter should have survived all\n      the others! But in the present instance,” he resumed, with a\n      singular alteration of voice and manner, “I have no right to be\n      merry at your expense. You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot\n      produce anything so fine as this, my little regal cabinet. My other\n      apartments are by no means of the same order—mere <i>ultras</i> of\n      fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion—is it not? Yet\n      this has but to be seen to become the rage—that is, with those who\n      could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony. I have guarded,\n      however, against any such profanation. With one exception, you are the\n      only human being besides myself and my <i>valet</i>, who has been\n      admitted within the mysteries of these imperial precincts, since they\n      have been bedizened as you see!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I bowed in acknowledgment—for the overpowering sense of splendor and\n      perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of his\n      address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my\n      appreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around\n      the apartment, “here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and from\n      Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with little\n      deference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting\n      tapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some <i>chefs d’oeuvre</i>\n      of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men, celebrated in\n      their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to\n      silence and to me. What think you,” said he, turning abruptly as he spoke—“what\n      think you of this Madonna della Pieta?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “It is Guido’s own!” I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for I\n      had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. “It is Guido’s\n      own!—how <i>could</i> you have obtained it?—she is undoubtedly\n      in painting what the Venus is in sculpture.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “Ha!” said he thoughtfully, “the Venus—the beautiful Venus?—the\n      Venus of the Medici?—she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair?\n      Part of the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with\n      difficulty,) and all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry of\n      that right arm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation. Give <i>me</i>\n      the Canova! The Apollo, too, is a copy—there can be no doubt of it—blind\n      fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo! I\n      cannot help—pity me!—I cannot help preferring the Antinous.\n      Was it not Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the\n      block of marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his\n      couplet—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     ‘Non ha l’ottimo artista alcun concetto<br>\n     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.’”\n </p>\n<p>\n      It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true\n      gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the\n      vulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what such\n      difference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full force\n      to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful\n      morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperament and\n      character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed\n      to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by\n      calling it a <i>habit</i> of intense and continual thought, pervading even\n      his most trivial actions—intruding upon his moments of dalliance—and\n      interweaving itself with his very flashes of merriment—like adders\n      which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices\n      around the temples of Persepolis.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled tone\n      of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon matters of\n      little importance, a certain air of trepidation—a degree of nervous\n      <i>unction</i> in action and in speech—an unquiet excitability of\n      manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon some\n      occasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the\n      middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he\n      seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in momentary\n      expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had existence in\n      his imagination alone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,\n      that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian’s beautiful\n      tragedy “The Orfeo,” (the first native Italian tragedy,) which lay near me\n      upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in pencil. It was a\n      passage towards the end of the third act—a passage of the most\n      heart-stirring excitement—a passage which, although tainted with\n      impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion—no\n      woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,\n      upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written in\n      a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance,\n      that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:—\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\nThou wast that all to me, love,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which my soul did pine—<br>\nA green isle in the sea, love,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fountain and a shrine,<br>\nAll wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the flowers were mine.<br>\n<br>\nAh, dream too bright to last!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise<br>\nBut to be overcast!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice from out the Future cries,<br>\n“Onward!”—but o’er the Past<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,<br>\nMute—motionless—aghast!<br>\n<br>\nFor alas!  alas!  with me<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of life is o’er.<br>\n“No more—no more—no more,”<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Such language holds the solemn sea<br>\nTo the sands upon the shore,)<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,<br>\nOr the stricken eagle soar!<br>\n<br>\nNow all my hours are trances;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my nightly dreams<br>\nAre where the dark eye glances,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where thy footstep gleams,<br>\nIn what ethereal dances,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By what Italian streams.<br>\n<br>\nAlas!  for that accursed time<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bore thee o’er the billow,<br>\nFrom Love to titled age and crime,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an unholy pillow!—<br>\nFrom me, and from our misty clime,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where weeps the silver willow!\n</p>\n<p>\n      That these lines were written in English—a language with which I had\n      not believed their author acquainted—afforded me little matter for\n      surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and of\n      the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation, to be\n      astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I must\n      confess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originally written\n      <i>London</i>, and afterwards carefully overscored—not, however, so\n      effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this\n      occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former\n      conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at any time\n      met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previous to her\n      marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistake not,\n      gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of Great\n      Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more than once heard,\n      (without, of course, giving credit to a report involving so many\n      improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was not only by birth,\n      but in education, an <i>Englishman</i>.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n“There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my notice\nof the tragedy—“there is still one painting which you have not\nseen.” And throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait\nof the Marchesa Aphrodite.\n</p>\n<p>\nHuman art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty.\nThe same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the\nsteps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again. But in the expression of\nthe countenance, which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked\n(incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be\nfound inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay\nfolded over her bosom. With her left she pointed downward to a curiously\nfashioned vase. One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth;\nand, scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle\nand enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most delicately imagined\nwings. My glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend, and the\nvigorous words of Chapman’s <i>Bussy D’Ambois</i>, quivered\ninstinctively upon my lips:\n</p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He is up<br>\nThere like a Roman statue!  He will stand<br>\nTill Death hath made him marble!”\n</p>\n<p>\n      “Come,” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled and\n      massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically stained,\n      together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same\n      extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and filled\n      with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. “Come,” he said, abruptly, “let\n      us drink! It is early—but let us drink. It is <i>indeed</i> early,”\n       he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the\n      apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: “It is <i>indeed</i>\n      early—but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an offering\n      to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so eager to\n      subdue!” And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he swallowed in rapid\n      succession several goblets of the wine.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory conversation,\n      as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the magnificent vases—“to\n      dream has been the business of my life. I have therefore framed for\n      myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have\n      erected a better? You behold around you, it is true, a medley of\n      architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is offended by\n      antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are outstretched upon\n      carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.\n      Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears which\n      terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent. Once I was\n      myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul.\n      All this is now the fitter for my purpose. Like these arabesque censers,\n      my spirit is writhing in fire, and the delirium of this scene is\n      fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither I\n      am now rapidly departing.” He here paused abruptly, bent his head to his\n      bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not hear. At length,\n      erecting his frame, he looked upwards, and ejaculated the lines of the\n      Bishop of Chichester:\n    </p>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n<i>“Stay for me there!  I will not fail</i><br>\n<i>To meet thee in that hollow vale.”</i>\n</p>\n<p class=\"noindent\">\n      In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself at\n      full-length upon an ottoman.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at the\n      door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second\n      disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s household burst into the room, and\n      faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words, “My\n      mistress!—my mistress!—Poisoned!—poisoned! Oh, beautiful—oh,\n      beautiful Aphrodite!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to\n      a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid—his\n      lips were livid—his lately beaming eyes were riveted in <i>death</i>.\n      I staggered back towards the table—my hand fell upon a cracked and\n      blackened goblet—and a consciousness of the entire and terrible\n      truth flashed suddenly over my soul.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.15\"></a>THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM</h2>\n<p class=\"poem\">\n     Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores<br>\n     Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.<br>\n     Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,<br>\n     Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.\n</p>\n<p class=\"center\">\n[<i>Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of\nthe Jacobin Club House at Paris</i>.]\n</p>\n<p>\n      I was sick—sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at\n      length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were\n      leaving me. The sentence—the dread sentence of death—was the\n      last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound\n      of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum.\n      It conveyed to my soul the idea of <i>revolution</i>—perhaps from its\n      association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief\n      period, for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw—but with\n      how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges.\n      They appeared to me white—whiter than the sheet upon which I trace\n      these words—and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity\n      of their expression of firmness—of immoveable resolution—of\n      stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was\n      Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly\n      locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered\n      because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious\n      horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies\n      which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon\n      the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the aspect of\n      charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then,\n      all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt\n      every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic\n      battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of\n      flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then there\n      stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet\n      rest there must be in the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily,\n      and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my\n      spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of\n      the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles\n      sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of\n      darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing\n      descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, night were\n      the universe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost.\n      What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to\n      describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber—no! In\n      delirium—no! In a swoon—no! In death—no! even in the\n      grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from\n      the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream.\n      Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember\n      not that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are\n      two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly,\n      that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon\n      reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first,\n      we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond.\n      And that gulf is—what? How at least shall we distinguish its shadows\n      from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have termed the\n      first stage are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they\n      not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never\n      swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in\n      coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions\n      that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some\n      novel flower; is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning\n      of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles\n      to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my\n      soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success;\n      there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up\n      remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have\n      had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These\n      shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore\n      me in silence down—down—still down—till a hideous\n      dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the\n      descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that\n      heart’s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness\n      throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!) had\n      outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the\n      wearisomeness of their toil. After this I call to mind flatness and\n      dampness; and then all is madness—the madness of a memory which\n      busies itself among forbidden things.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound—the\n      tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating.\n      Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and motion, and\n      touch—a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the mere\n      consciousness of existence, without thought—a condition which lasted\n      long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest\n      endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into\n      insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to\n      move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable\n      draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then entire\n      forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much\n      earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound.\n      I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard.\n      There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine\n      where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I\n      dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to\n      look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be\n      nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly\n      unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness\n      of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of\n      the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was\n      intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my\n      reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted\n      from that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed; and\n      it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet\n      not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition,\n      notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with\n      real existence;—but where and in what state was I? The condemned to\n      death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had\n      been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to\n      my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for\n      many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in\n      immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells\n      at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and\n      for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon\n      recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every\n      fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. I\n      felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the\n      walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big\n      beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable,\n      and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes\n      straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of\n      light. I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and\n      vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident that mine was not, at\n      least, the most hideous of fates.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came\n      thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of\n      Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated—fables\n      I had always deemed them—but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat,\n      save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean\n      world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me?\n      That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary\n      bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode\n      and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It was\n      a wall, seemingly of stone masonry—very smooth, slimy, and cold. I\n      followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain\n      antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no\n      means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its\n      circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of\n      the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I therefore sought the\n      knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial\n      chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of\n      coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of\n      the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. The difficulty,\n      nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it\n      seemed at first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and\n      placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. In\n      groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag\n      upon completing the circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted\n      upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was\n      moist and slippery. I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and\n      fell. My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon\n      overtook me as I lay.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a\n      pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this\n      circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I resumed\n      my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon the\n      fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted\n      fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight\n      more—when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred\n      paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be\n      fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the wall,\n      and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault, for vault I\n      could not help supposing it to be.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had little object—certainly no hope—in these researches; but\n      a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I\n      resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with\n      extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was\n      treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not\n      hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as\n      possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the\n      remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs. I\n      stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a\n      somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,\n      and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this: my\n      chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper\n      portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin,\n      touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy\n      vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I\n      put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the very\n      brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of\n      ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just below the\n      margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into\n      the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed\n      against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length there was a\n      sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment\n      there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a\n      door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the\n      gloom, and as suddenly faded away.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated\n      myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step\n      before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just\n      avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and\n      frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its\n      tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,\n      or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for the\n      latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at\n      the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting\n      subject for the species of torture which awaited me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall—resolving there\n      to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my\n      imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon. In\n      other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once\n      by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of\n      cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits—that\n      the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours, but at length I\n      again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and\n      a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel\n      at a draught. It must have been drugged—for scarcely had I drunk, before\n      I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me—a sleep like\n      that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once\n      again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild\n      sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I\n      was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls\n      did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned me\n      a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less\n      importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the\n      mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in\n      trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had\n      committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my\n      first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the\n      period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the\n      fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the\n      vault. I then slept—and, upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps—thus\n      supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My confusion of\n      mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the\n      left, and ended it with the wall to the right.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. In\n      feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great\n      irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing\n      from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight\n      depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison\n      was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some\n      other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the\n      depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely\n      daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel\n      superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects\n      of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images,\n      overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these\n      monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded\n      and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now noticed\n      the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned the circular pit\n      from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort—for my personal\n      condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my\n      back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this\n      I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed in\n      many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my\n      head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much\n      exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my\n      side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been\n      removed. I say to my horror—for I was consumed with intolerable\n      thirst. This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to\n      stimulate—for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty or\n      forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one of its\n      panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was the\n      painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu\n      of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the\n      pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There\n      was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me\n      to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward at it (for\n      its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in\n      motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was\n      brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in\n      fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull\n      movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw\n      several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which\n      lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they came up\n      in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the\n      meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take\n      but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What I\n      then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had increased\n      in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its velocity was\n      also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had\n      perceptibly descended. I now observed—with what horror it is\n      needless to say—that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent\n      of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns\n      upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a\n      razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid\n      and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and\n      the whole hissed as it swung through the air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in\n      torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial\n      agents—<i>the pit</i>, whose horrors had been destined for so bold a\n      recusant as myself—the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor\n      as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I\n      had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or\n      entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the\n      grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no\n      part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no\n      alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I\n      half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal,\n      during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch by inch—line\n      by line—with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed\n      ages—down and still down it came! Days passed—it might have\n      been that many days passed—ere it swept so closely over me as to fan\n      me with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into\n      my nostrils. I prayed—I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more\n      speedy descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself\n      upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly\n      calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare\n      bauble.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon\n      again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the\n      pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who\n      took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at\n      pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very—oh! inexpressibly—sick\n      and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that\n      period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched\n      my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small\n      remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion of it\n      within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy—of\n      hope. Yet what business had <i>I</i> with hope? It was, as I say, a half formed\n      thought—man has many such, which are never completed. I felt that it\n      was of joy—of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its\n      formation. In vain I struggled to perfect—to regain it. Long\n      suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an\n      imbecile—an idiot.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw that\n      the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. It would fray\n      the serge of my robe—it would return and repeat its operations—again—and\n      again. Notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more)\n      and the hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very\n      walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several\n      minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I paused. I dared not go\n      farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of\n      attention—as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of\n      the steel. I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it\n      should pass across the garment—upon the peculiar thrilling sensation\n      which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all\n      this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Down—steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in\n      contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right—to\n      the left—far and wide—with the shriek of a damned spirit! to\n      my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and\n      howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Down—certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches\n      of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This\n      was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from\n      the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.\n      Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized\n      and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to\n      arrest an avalanche!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Down—still unceasingly—still inevitably down! I gasped and\n      struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My\n      eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most\n      unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,\n      although death would have been a relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I\n      quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery\n      would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope\n      that prompted the nerve to quiver—the frame to shrink. It was hope—the\n      hope that triumphs on the rack—that whispers to the death-condemned\n      even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual\n      contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over\n      my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first time\n      during many hours—or perhaps days—I thought. It now occurred\n      to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I\n      was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent\n      athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be\n      unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that\n      case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle how\n      deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not\n      foreseen and provided for this possibility? Was it probable that the\n      bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my\n      faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my\n      head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my\n      limbs and body close in all directions—save in the path of the\n      destroying crescent.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there\n      flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed\n      half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and\n      of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I\n      raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now present—feeble,\n      scarcely sane, scarcely definite,—but still entire. I proceeded at\n      once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I\n      lay had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,\n      ravenous—their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for\n      motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. “To what food,” I\n      thought, “have they been accustomed in the well?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a\n      small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual\n      see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter; and, at length, the\n      unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their\n      voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.\n      With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I\n      thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my\n      hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change—at\n      the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the\n      well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their\n      voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the\n      boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This\n      seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in\n      fresh troops. They clung to the wood—they overran it, and leaped in\n      hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed\n      them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the\n      anointed bandage. They pressed—they swarmed upon me in ever\n      accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my\n      own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which\n      the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy\n      clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would\n      be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in\n      more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human\n      resolution I lay still.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Nor had I erred in my calculations—nor had I endured in vain. I at\n      length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.\n      But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had\n      divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath. Twice\n      again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But\n      the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers\n      hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement—cautious,\n      sidelong, shrinking, and slow—I slid from the embrace of the bandage\n      and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was\n      free.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Free!—and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped\n      from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the\n      motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some\n      invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took\n      desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!—I\n      had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse\n      than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves nervously\n      around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual—some\n      change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly—it was\n      obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy\n      and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected\n      conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the\n      origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from\n      a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the\n      prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely\n      separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look\n      through the aperture.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber\n      broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that, although the\n      outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the\n      colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and\n      were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that\n      gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have\n      thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly\n      vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been\n      visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could\n      not force my imagination to regard as unreal.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Unreal!</i>—Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath\n      of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A\n      deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! A\n      richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood.\n      I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my\n      tormentors—oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I shrank\n      from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the thought of the\n      fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came\n      over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink. I threw my straining\n      vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost\n      recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the\n      meaning of what I saw. At length it forced—it wrestled its way into\n      my soul—it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. Oh! for\n      a voice to speak!—oh! horror!—oh! any horror but this! With a\n      shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands—weeping\n      bitterly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with\n      a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell—and\n      now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that\n      I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking\n      place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had\n      been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying\n      with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its\n      iron angles were now acute—two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful\n      difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an\n      instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But the\n      alteration stopped not here—I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I\n      could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal\n      peace. “Death,” I said, “any death but that of the pit!” Fool! might I\n      have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to\n      urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its\n      pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity\n      that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its\n      greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank back—but\n      the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length for my seared\n      and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm\n      floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found\n      vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I\n      tottered upon the brink—I averted my eyes—\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of\n      many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The\n      fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,\n      fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French army\n      had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.16\"></a>THE PREMATURE BURIAL</h2>\n<p>\n      There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which\n      are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction. These\n      the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or to\n      disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and\n      majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with\n      the most intense of “pleasurable pain” over the accounts of the Passage of\n      the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London, of the\n      Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred and\n      twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in these\n      accounts it is the fact——it is the reality——it is\n      the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them with\n      simple abhorrence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on\n      record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character of the\n      calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind the\n      reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might\n      have selected many individual instances more replete with essential\n      suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true\n      wretchedness, indeed—the ultimate woe——is particular,\n      not diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the\n      unit, and never by man the mass——for this let us thank a\n      merciful God!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these\n      extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has\n      frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those\n      who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy\n      and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?\n      We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the\n      apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations are\n      merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only temporary pauses in\n      the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period elapses, and some unseen\n      mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard\n      wheels. The silver cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl\n      irreparably broken. But where, meantime, was the soul?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, <i>a priori</i> that such causes\n      must produce such effects——that the well-known occurrence of\n      such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then,\n      to premature interments—apart from this consideration, we have the\n      direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast\n      number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer at\n      once, if necessary, to a hundred well-authenticated instances. One of very\n      remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the\n      memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the\n      neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and\n      widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable\n      citizens—a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress—was\n      seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled\n      the skill of her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was\n      supposed to die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that\n      she was not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of\n      death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips\n      were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no\n      warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved\n      unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in\n      short, was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed\n      to be decomposition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent\n      years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened for\n      the reception of a sarcophagus; but, alas! how fearful a shock awaited\n      the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its portals swung\n      outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his\n      arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within\n      two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had\n      caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so\n      broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally left,\n      full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been\n      exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which\n      led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with\n      which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking\n      the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly\n      died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became entangled\n      in some iron-work which projected interiorly. Thus she remained, and\n      thus she rotted, erect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France, attended\n      with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is,\n      indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle\n      Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and\n      of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a\n      poor <i>litterateur</i>, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general\n      amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he\n      seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her,\n      finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a\n      diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this gentleman\n      neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. Having\n      passed with him some wretched years, she died—at least her\n      condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her.\n      She was buried——not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in\n      the village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by\n      the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital\n      to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic\n      purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its\n      luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the\n      coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is\n      arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been\n      buried alive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by\n      the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for\n      death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He employed\n      certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. In\n      fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She remained with him\n      until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. Her\n      woman’s heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to\n      soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her\n      husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to\n      America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the\n      persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady’s appearance that her\n      friends would be unable to recognize her. They were mistaken, however,\n      for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and\n      make claim to his wife. This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal\n      sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances,\n      with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but\n      legally, the authority of the husband.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The “Chirurgical Journal” of Leipsic, a periodical of high authority\n      and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate and\n      republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the\n      character in question.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust health,\n      being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe contusion\n      upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the skull was\n      slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended. Trepanning\n      was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other of the ordinary\n      means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fell into a more and\n      more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he died.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the\n      public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday\n      following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged with\n      visitors, and about noon an intense excitement was created by the\n      declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the\n      officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned\n      by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the\n      man’s asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with\n      which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon\n      the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was\n      shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head\n      of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly\n      erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he\n      had partially uplifted.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced to\n      be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours he\n      revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken\n      sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of\n      life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into\n      insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an\n      exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted. He\n      heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself\n      heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he\n      said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he\n      awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair\n      way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical\n      experiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in\n      one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory a\n      well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action proved\n      the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London, who had\n      been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created, at the\n      time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject of\n      converse.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever,\n      accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity\n      of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends were\n      requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit\n      it. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners\n      resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.\n      Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of\n      body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after\n      the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet\n      deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private\n      hospitals.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when the\n      fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of\n      the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects\n      supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon\n      one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the\n      convulsive action.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient, at\n      length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, was\n      especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon\n      applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was\n      made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a\n      hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped\n      into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds,\n      and then—spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words were\n      uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell heavily\n      to the floor.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For some moments all were paralyzed with awe—but the urgency of the\n      case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.\n      Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he\n      revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his\n      friends—from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was\n      withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their wonder—their\n      rapturous astonishment—may be conceived.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is involved\n      in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period was he\n      altogether insensible—that, dully and confusedly, he was aware of\n      everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was\n      pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to\n      the floor of the hospital. “I am alive,” were the uncomprehended words\n      which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had\n      endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these—but I\n      forbear—for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact\n      that premature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the\n      nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must admit\n      that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth,\n      is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent,\n      that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of\n      suspicions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Fearful indeed the suspicion—but more fearful the doom! It may be\n      asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to\n      inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial\n      before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs—the stifling\n      fumes from the damp earth—the clinging to the death garments—the\n      rigid embrace of the narrow house—the blackness of the absolute\n      Night—the silence like a sea that overwhelms—the unseen but\n      palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm—these things, with the\n      thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would\n      fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of\n      this fate they can never be informed—that our hopeless portion is\n      that of the really dead—these considerations, I say, carry into the\n      heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable\n      horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of\n      nothing so agonizing upon Earth—we can dream of nothing half so\n      hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon\n      this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which,\n      through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very\n      peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter\n      narrated. What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge—of\n      my own positive and personal experience.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder\n      which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more\n      definitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes,\n      and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its\n      obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood. Its\n      variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a\n      day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated\n      lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of\n      the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a\n      slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application\n      of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating\n      action of the lungs. Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks—even\n      for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical\n      tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the\n      sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. Very usually he is saved\n      from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he\n      has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion\n      excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of\n      the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although\n      marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more\n      distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding. In this\n      lies the principal security from inhumation. The unfortunate whose first\n      attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen,\n      would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in\n      medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by\n      little, into a condition of semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this\n      condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking,\n      to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the\n      presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of\n      the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other times I\n      was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and chilly,\n      and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void,\n      and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation\n      could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a\n      gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure. Just as the\n      day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who roams the streets\n      throughout the long desolate winter night—just so tardily—just\n      so wearily—just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to\n      be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one\n      prevalent malady—unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary\n      sleep may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I\n      could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always\n      remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity—the\n      mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a\n      condition of absolute abeyance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral\n      distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked “of worms, of\n      tombs, and epitaphs.” I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of\n      premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly Danger\n      to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former, the\n      torture of meditation was excessive—in the latter, supreme. When the\n      grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I\n      shook—shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When Nature\n      could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I\n      consented to sleep—for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I\n      might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into\n      slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above\n      which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one\n      sepulchral Idea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams, I\n      select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in a\n      cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly\n      there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice\n      whispered the word “Arise!” within my ear.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him who\n      had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I had\n      fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While I\n      remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought, the\n      cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while\n      the gibbering voice said again:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Arise! did I not bid thee arise?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “And who,” I demanded, “art thou?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,” replied the voice,\n      mournfully; “I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am pitiful.\n      Thou dost feel that I shudder. My teeth chatter as I speak, yet it\n      is not with the chilliness of the night—of the night without end.\n      But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly sleep? I\n      cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights are more than\n      I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer Night, and let me\n      unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of woe?—Behold!”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had\n      caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind; and from each issued\n      the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so that I could see into the\n      innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and\n      solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by\n      many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble\n      struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of\n      the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of\n      the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a\n      vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy\n      position in which they had originally been entombed. And the voice again\n      said to me as I gazed:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Is it not—oh! is it <i>not</i> a pitiful sight?” But, before I could\n      find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the\n      phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden\n      violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying\n      again: “Is it not—O, God, is it <i>not</i> a very pitiful sight?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their\n      terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly\n      unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or\n      to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home. In\n      fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of\n      those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one\n      of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be\n      ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends. I\n      dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might\n      be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so far as to\n      fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider\n      any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me\n      altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most\n      solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no\n      circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially\n      advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even then, my\n      mortal terrors would listen to no reason—would accept no\n      consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among other\n      things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily\n      opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended\n      far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were\n      arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient\n      receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin\n      intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and\n      was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door,\n      with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of\n      the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there\n      was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which,\n      it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be\n      fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas? what avails the\n      vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these well-contrived\n      securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living\n      inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There arrived an epoch—as often before there had arrived—in\n      which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first\n      feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly—with a tortoise\n      gradation—approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A\n      torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care—no\n      hope—no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears;\n      then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the\n      extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,\n      during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a\n      brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the\n      slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric\n      shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in\n      torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive effort\n      to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a partial and\n      evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained its dominion,\n      that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not\n      awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to\n      catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering\n      spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger—by the one spectral and\n      ever-prevalent idea.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion.\n      And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not make the effort\n      which was to satisfy me of my fate—and yet there was something at my\n      heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair—such as no other\n      species of wretchedness ever calls into being—despair alone urged\n      me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. I\n      uplifted them. It was dark—all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I\n      knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had now\n      fully recovered the use of my visual faculties—and yet it was dark—all\n      dark—the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth\n      for evermore.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved\n      convulsively together in the attempt—but no voice issued from the\n      cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent\n      mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and\n      struggling inspiration.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they\n      were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay upon\n      some hard substance; and by something similar my sides were, also, closely\n      compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs—but\n      now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length, with the\n      wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above\n      my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. I\n      could no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope—for\n      I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to\n      force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists for the bell-rope:\n      it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still\n      sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the\n      absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared—and then,\n      too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist\n      earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was not within the vault. I had\n      fallen into a trance while absent from home—while among strangers—when,\n      or how, I could not remember—and it was they who had buried me as a\n      dog—nailed up in some common coffin—and thrust deep, deep, and\n      for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost chambers\n      of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this second\n      endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or yell of\n      agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Hillo! hillo, there!” said a gruff voice, in reply.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What the devil’s the matter now!” said a second.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Get out o’ that!” said a third.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a\n      cattymount?” said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without\n      ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking\n      individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber—for I was wide\n      awake when I screamed—but they restored me to the full possession of\n      my memory.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a\n      friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the\n      banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by a\n      storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden\n      with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made the\n      best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the only two\n      berths in the vessel—and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty\n      tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of\n      any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of its\n      bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it a matter\n      of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I slept\n      soundly, and the whole of my vision—for it was no dream, and no\n      nightmare—arose naturally from the circumstances of my position—from\n      my ordinary bias of thought—and from the difficulty, to which I have\n      alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory,\n      for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the\n      crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load\n      itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a silk\n      handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary\n      nightcap.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time,\n      to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully—they were\n      inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very\n      excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired tone—acquired\n      temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air\n      of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my\n      medical books. “Buchan” I burned. I read no “Night Thoughts”—no\n      fustian about churchyards—no bugaboo tales—such as this. In\n      short, I became a new man, and lived a man’s life. From that memorable\n      night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them\n      vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less\n      the consequence than the cause.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our\n      sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell—but the imagination\n      of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!\n      the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether\n      fanciful—but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his\n      voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us—they\n      must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.\n    </p>\n",

Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. I mean\n      it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemed born\n      for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price,\n      Priestley, and Condorcet—of exemplifying by individual instance what\n      has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence\n      of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in man’s very\n      nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. An anxious\n      examination of his career has given me to understand that in general, from\n      the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of\n      mankind—that as a species we have in our possession the as yet\n      unwrought elements of content—and that, even now, in the present\n      darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social\n      condition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain\n      unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and\n      thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which\n      distinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert. It\n      is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now\n      and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would\n      have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success of his\n      life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of\n      pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen an essay on\n      happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words. He\n      admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly, conditions of\n      bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and\n      purely physical one of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he\n      said, “attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.” He instanced\n      the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the tillers of the earth,\n      the only people who, as a class, can be fairly considered happier than\n      others. His second condition was the love of woman. His third, and most\n      difficult of realization, was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an\n      object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal,\n      the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the spirituality\n      of this object.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished\n      upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men. His\n      intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of knowledge is less\n      a labor than an intuition and a necessity. His family was one of the most\n      illustrious of the empire. His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of\n      women. His possessions had been always ample; but on the attainment of his\n      majority, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate\n      had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid\n      which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the moral\n      constitution of those who are their objects.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison’s coming of age,\n      there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This\n      gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate\n      connections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for\n      a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the\n      various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the\n      nearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at the\n      end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside this\n      singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them abortive;\n      but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a legislative\n      act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations. This act,\n      however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into possession, on\n      his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor Seabright, of a\n      fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. (*1)\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,\n      there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.\n      The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all who\n      thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount of money\n      might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. With\n      riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy to\n      suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of\n      his time—or busying himself with political intrigue—or aiming\n      at ministerial power—or purchasing increase of nobility—or\n      collecting large museums of virtu—or playing the munificent patron\n      of letters, of science, of art—or endowing, and bestowing his name\n      upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the inconceivable wealth\n      in the actual possession of the heir, these objects and all ordinary\n      objects were felt to afford too limited a field. Recourse was had to\n      figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It was seen that, even at\n      three per cent., the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less\n      than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was one\n      million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six\n      thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day; or one thousand five hundred\n      and forty-one per hour; or six and twenty dollars for every minute that\n      flew. Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men\n      knew not what to imagine. There were some who even conceived that Mr.\n      Ellison would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of\n      utterly superfluous opulence—enriching whole troops of his relatives\n      by division of his superabundance. To the nearest of these he did, in\n      fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which was his own before the\n      inheritance.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his\n      mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.\n      Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard to\n      individual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the possibility\n      of any improvement, properly so called, being effected by man himself in\n      the general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little\n      faith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back,\n      in very great measure, upon self.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended, moreover,\n      the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of\n      the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole proper satisfaction of\n      this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms\n      of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the\n      nature of his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism all\n      his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which led him to\n      believe that the most advantageous at least, if not the sole legitimate\n      field for the poetic exercise, lies in the creation of novel moods of\n      purely physical loveliness. Thus it happened he became neither musician\n      nor poet—if we use this latter term in its every-day acceptation. Or\n      it might have been that he neglected to become either, merely in pursuance\n      of his idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the\n      essential principles of happiness on earth. Is it not indeed, possible\n      that, while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest\n      is above that which is termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that\n      many far greater than Milton have contentedly remained “mute and\n      inglorious?” I believe that the world has never seen—and that,\n      unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind\n      into distasteful exertion, the world will never see—that full extent\n      of triumphant execution, in the richer domains of art, of which the human\n      nature is absolutely capable.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more\n      profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances than\n      those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become a\n      painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was too\n      limited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time,\n      much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which\n      the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it capable\n      of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, the truest, and\n      most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province, had been\n      unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of the\n      landscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that the\n      creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most\n      magnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for the\n      display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty;\n      the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast superiority, the\n      most glorious which the earth could afford. In the multiform and\n      multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised the most direct and\n      energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. And in the direction\n      or concentration of this effort—or, more properly, in its adaptation\n      to the eyes which were to behold it on earth—he perceived that he\n      should be employing the best means—laboring to the greatest\n      advantage—in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as poet,\n      but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the poetic\n      sentiment in man.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.” In his\n      explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving what\n      has always seemed to me an enigma:—I mean the fact (which none but\n      the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in nature\n      as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to be found in\n      reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most enchanting of\n      natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect or an excess—many\n      excesses and defects. While the component parts may defy, individually,\n      the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of these parts will\n      always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no position can be\n      attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from which an\n      artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of offence in what\n      is termed the “composition” of the landscape. And yet how unintelligible\n      is this! In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as\n      supreme. With her details we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to\n      imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily\n      of the valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or portraiture, that\n      here nature is to be exalted or idealized rather than imitated, is in\n      error. No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human\n      liveliness do more than approach the living and breathing beauty. In\n      landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its\n      truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led\n      him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I say,\n      felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The\n      mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of\n      his art yields the artist. He not only believes, but positively knows,\n      that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute\n      and alone constitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet\n      been matured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis than\n      the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.\n      Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of\n      all his brethren. Let a “composition” be defective; let an emendation be\n      wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted\n      to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be admitted. And\n      even far more than this; in remedy of the defective composition,\n      each insulated member of the fraternity would have suggested the identical\n      emendation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature\n      susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of\n      improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.\n      My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive\n      intention of nature would have so arranged the earth’s surface as to have\n      fulfilled at all points man’s sense of perfection in the beautiful, the\n      sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had been\n      frustrated by the known geological disturbances—disturbances of form\n      and color—grouping, in the correction or allaying of which lies the\n      soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by the\n      necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and\n      unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested that they were\n      prognostic of death. He thus explained:—Admit the earthly\n      immortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then the\n      primitive arrangement of the earth’s surface adapted to his blissful\n      estate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were the\n      preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Now,” said my friend, “what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may\n      be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view. Each\n      alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in the\n      picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large—in mass—from\n      some point distant from the earth’s surface, although not beyond the\n      limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that what might improve\n      a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure a general or\n      more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of beings, human\n      once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar, our disorder may\n      seem order—our unpicturesqueness picturesque; in a word, the\n      earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own, and for\n      whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful, may have been set\n      in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a writer\n      on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treated his\n      theme:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural and\n      the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of the country, by\n      adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating trees in\n      harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and\n      bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion, and color\n      which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to the\n      experienced student of nature. The result of the natural style of\n      gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities—in\n      the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order—than in the creation\n      of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial style has as many\n      varieties as there are different tastes to gratify. It has a certain\n      general relation to the various styles of building. There are the stately\n      avenues and retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various\n      mixed old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic\n      or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said against the\n      abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a\n      garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the\n      eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an\n      old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms\n      that have passed there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is\n      an evidence of care and human interest.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      “From what I have already observed,” said Ellison, “you will understand\n      that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beauty\n      of the country. The original beauty is never so great as that which may be\n      introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of a spot with\n      capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing into practice nice\n      relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses\n      of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase quoted may\n      mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree. That the true result\n      of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all\n      defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or\n      miracles, is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of\n      the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative\n      merit suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters,\n      would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which\n      consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the\n      understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue,\n      which flames in creation, can be apprehended in its results alone. Rule\n      applies but to the merits of denial—to the excellencies which\n      refrain. Beyond these, the critical art can but suggest. We may be\n      instructed to build a “Cato,” but we are in vain told how to conceive a\n      Parthenon or an “Inferno.” The thing done, however; the wonder\n      accomplished; and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The\n      sophists of the negative school who, through inability to create, have\n      scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What, in its\n      chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never\n      fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their\n      instinct of beauty.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued Ellison,\n      “are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to\n      it a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense of\n      human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible—but\n      there may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping with\n      the principle—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily\n      possessed by individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to\n      the landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human\n      interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources,\n      might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as our\n      author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with extent\n      and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual\n      interference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he\n      secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work\n      of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged of\n      wildernesses—in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature—there\n      is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent to reflection\n      only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. Now let us\n      suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed—to\n      be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of\n      human art—to form an intermedium between the two:—let us\n      imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and\n      definitiveness—whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness,\n      shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part\n      of beings superior, yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of\n      interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air\n      of an intermediate or secondary nature—a nature which is not God,\n      nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the\n      handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision such\n      as this—in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the personal\n      superintendence of his plans—in the unceasing object which these\n      plans afforded—in the high spirituality of the object—in the\n      contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel—in the\n      perennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of\n      satiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,\n      above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose\n      loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of\n      Paradise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from the\n      ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive\n      happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Staël.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the\n      marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe, but\n      am disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate between\n      detail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to unite the two\n      in their extremes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Mr. Ellison’s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,\n      and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the luxuriant\n      nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In fact, he had made\n      up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a night’s reflection\n      induced him to abandon the idea. “Were I misanthropic,” he said, “such a\n      locale would suit me. The thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion,\n      and the difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such case be the charm\n      of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the composure but not the\n      depression of solitude. There must remain with me a certain control over\n      the extent and duration of my repose. There will be frequent hours in\n      which I shall need, too, the sympathy of the poetic in what I have done.\n      Let me seek, then, a spot not far from a populous city—whose\n      vicinity, also, will best enable me to execute my plans.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for several\n      years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots with which I\n      was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons which satisfied\n      me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to an elevated\n      table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording a panoramic\n      prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and, in Ellison’s\n      opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed view from that\n      mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “I am aware,” said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delight after\n      gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, “I know that here, in\n      my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men would rest\n      content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I should rejoice in it but\n      for the excess of its glory. The taste of all the architects I have ever\n      known leads them, for the sake of ‘prospect,’ to put up buildings on\n      hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of its moods, but\n      especially in that of extent, startles, excites—and then fatigues,\n      depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better—for the\n      constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the most\n      objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase of\n      extent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with the\n      sense of seclusion—the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in\n      ‘retiring to the country.’ In looking from the summit of a mountain we\n      cannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant\n      prospects as a pestilence.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that we\n      found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. It is, of\n      course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death of my\n      friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes of\n      visitors, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not\n      solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior in degree,\n      to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visitor left the city\n      in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores of a\n      tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep, their\n      white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By degrees the\n      idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral care. This\n      slowly became merged in a sense of retirement—this again in a\n      consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grew\n      more narrow; the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter were\n      clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water\n      increased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at no\n      moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance than a\n      furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an enchanted\n      circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage, a roof of\n      ultramarine satin, and no floor—the keel balancing itself with\n      admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident having\n      been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the substantial\n      one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now became a gorge—although\n      the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ it merely because the\n      language has no word which better represents the most striking—not\n      the most distinctive—feature of the scene. The character of gorge\n      was maintained only in the height and parallelism of the shores; it was\n      lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of the ravine (through\n      which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose to an elevation of a\n      hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet, and inclined so much\n      toward each other as, in a great measure, to shut out the light of day;\n      while the long plume-like moss which depended densely from the\n      intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole chasm an air of funereal\n      gloom. The windings became more frequent and intricate, and seemed often\n      as if returning in upon themselves, so that the voyager had long lost all\n      idea of direction. He was, moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the\n      strange. The thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to\n      have undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling\n      uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not a dead branch—not\n      a withered leaf—not a stray pebble—not a patch of the brown\n      earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled up against the clean\n      granite, or the unblemished moss, with a sharpness of outline that\n      delighted while it bewildered the eye.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom\n      deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel brought\n      it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of very\n      considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. It was\n      about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but one—that\n      immediately fronting the vessel as it entered—by hills equal in\n      general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly\n      different character. Their sides sloped from the water’s edge at an angle\n      of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to summit—not\n      a perceptible point escaping—in a drapery of the most gorgeous\n      flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the sea of\n      odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, but so\n      transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of a\n      thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible by\n      glimpses—that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not to\n      see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the hills.\n      On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size. The\n      impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness, warmth, color,\n      quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness, voluptuousness, and\n      a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested dreams of a new race of\n      fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye\n      traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction with the\n      water to its vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud, it\n      became, indeed, difficult not to fancy a panoramic cataract of rubies,\n      sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the\n      ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,\n      which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now\n      confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless\n      vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and\n      descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in\n      vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boat\n      arise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form is\n      that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the bay with the\n      proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a single feathery\n      paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen. The guest\n      is bidden to be of good cheer—that the fates will take care of him.\n      The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the canoe, which\n      lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake. While he considers\n      what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a gentle movement in\n      the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around until its prow points\n      toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but gradually accelerated\n      velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to break about the\n      ivory side in divinest melody—seem to offer the only possible explanation\n      of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the\n      bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is\n      approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To the right\n      arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It is\n      observed, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank\n      dips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the usual\n      river <i>débris</i>. To the left the character of the scene is softer and more\n      obviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a\n      very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture resembling\n      nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which would bear\n      comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateau varies in\n      width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the river-bank to a\n      wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of curves, but\n      following the general direction of the river, until lost in the distance\n      to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and has been formed\n      by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of the stream’s\n      southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered to remain. The\n      chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely overhung and\n      overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the\n      clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully\n      relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in\n      small groups, both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall,\n      but in close proximity to it; so that frequent limbs (of the black walnut\n      especially) reach over and dip their pendent extremities into the water.\n      Farther back within the domain, the vision is impeded by an impenetrable\n      screen of foliage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      These things are observed during the canoe’s gradual approach to what I\n      have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however, its\n      chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is discovered to\n      the left—in which direction the wall is also seen to sweep, still\n      following the general course of the stream. Down this new opening the eye\n      cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied by the wall, still\n      bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by the leaves.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and\n      here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite the\n      wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally into\n      mountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in\n      the scene.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, the\n      voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred by a\n      gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved and\n      fretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun with\n      an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames.\n      This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to cross the\n      river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen that the main\n      body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the\n      left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of considerable\n      volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way, with a slight\n      ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight. The canoe falls\n      into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its ponderous wings are\n      slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides between them, and commences\n      a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple\n      mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout the full\n      extent of their circuit. Meantime the whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts\n      upon the view. There is a gush of entrancing melody; there is an\n      oppressive sense of strange sweet odor;—there is a dream-like\n      intermingling to the eye of tall slender Eastern trees—bosky\n      shrubberies—flocks of golden and crimson birds—lily-fringed\n      lakes—meadows of violets, tulips, poppies, hyacinths, and tuberoses—long\n      intertangled lines of silver streamlets—and, upspringing confusedly\n      from amid all, a mass of semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture\n      sustaining itself by miracle in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight\n      with a hundred oriels, minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom\n      handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of\n      the Gnomes.\n    </p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.18\"></a>LANDOR’S COTTAGE</h2>\n<p class=\"center\">\nA Pendant to “The Domain of Arnheim”\n </p>\n<p>\n      During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river\n      counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat\n      embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very\n      remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so\n      confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in\n      what direction lay the sweet village of B——, where I had\n      determined to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone—strictly\n      speaking—during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly\n      warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all\n      things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much\n      about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even\n      before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or\n      something of that kind, would soon make its appearance—although, in\n      fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than\n      fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for\n      a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the\n      thing which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease—Ponto\n      taking charge of my gun—until at length, just as I had begun to\n      consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither,\n      were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an\n      unquestionable carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces\n      of light wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and\n      overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever\n      below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon—the most\n      aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in\n      being open through the wood—if wood be not too weighty a name for\n      such an assemblage of light trees—and except in the particulars of\n      evident wheel-tracks—bore no resemblance to any road I had before\n      seen. The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible—having\n      been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of—what\n      looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else. It was grass,\n      clearly—but grass such as we seldom see out of England—so\n      short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color. Not a single impediment\n      lay in the wheel-route—not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that\n      once obstructed the way had been carefully <i>placed</i>—not thrown—along\n      the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a\n      kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition.\n      Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art undoubtedly—that\n      did not surprise me—all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of\n      art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of\n      art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done\n      here—with such natural “capabilities” (as they have it in the books\n      on Landscape Gardening)—with very little labor and expense. No; it\n      was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a\n      seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy-like\n      avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration. One thing became\n      more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most\n      scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements. The\n      greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and\n      graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the\n      Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long\n      uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color appeared\n      twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was\n      variety in uniformity. It was a piece of “composition,” in which the most\n      fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I\n      continued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that at no\n      moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in\n      advance. Its character did not undergo any material change.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear—and in a few\n      moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than\n      hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a\n      gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing distinctly on account\n      of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. A gentle breeze,\n      however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained\n      standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became dissipated\n      into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As it came fully into view—thus gradually as I describe it—piece\n      by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit\n      of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of the\n      ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of “vanishing\n      pictures.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun had\n      made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if with a slight\n      chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring with a\n      purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west.\n      Suddenly, therefore—and as if by the hand of magic—this whole\n      valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The first <i>coup d’œil</i>, as the sun slid into the position described,\n      impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by the\n      concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or melodrama.\n      Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the sunlight came out\n      through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while the vivid green of\n      the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from\n      the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its\n      total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy\n      could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth it\n      varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred. It was\n      most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended\n      southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion was\n      within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which encompassed\n      the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face.\n      Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet;\n      and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not more than fifty\n      feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded southwardly from the cliff, he\n      found on his right hand and on his left, declivities at once less high,\n      less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word, sloped and softened to\n      the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less\n      high, except at two points. One of these I have already spoken of. It lay\n      considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting sun made its\n      way, as I have before described, into the amphitheatre, through a cleanly\n      cut natural cleft in the granite embankment; this fissure might have been\n      ten yards wide at its widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It\n      seemed to lead up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of\n      unexplored mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the\n      southern end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were nothing more\n      than gentle inclinations, extending from east to west about one hundred\n      and fifty yards. In the middle of this extent was a depression, level with\n      the ordinary floor of the valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in\n      respect to every thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south.\n      To the north—on the craggy precipice—a few paces from the\n      verge—up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black\n      walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the strong\n      lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially, spread far over the\n      edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the\n      same class of trees, but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character;\n      then he saw the gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust—these\n      again by the softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple—these yet\n      again by still more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of\n      the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone—an\n      occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the\n      valley itself—(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation\n      hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)—were to be\n      seen three insulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite\n      form: it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a\n      hickory, much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree,\n      although both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge\n      of the northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very\n      jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly\n      forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About\n      thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,\n      and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen,\n      unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a\n      triple-stemmed tulip-tree—the Liriodendron Tulipiferum—one of\n      the natural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent\n      at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and\n      gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the\n      largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about\n      eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundred\n      and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,\n      vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance they\n      were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by\n      the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely\n      congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only\n      thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And then\n      the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated columnar stems, the\n      largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the ground. The innumerable\n      blossoms, mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful,\n      although infinitely less majestic, filled the valley with more than\n      Arabian perfumes.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as\n      that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,\n      velvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all this\n      beauty had been attained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the northwest\n      issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down\n      the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang\n      the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on a\n      little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to\n      the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came\n      near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.\n      At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and\n      pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went—until\n      it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly\n      oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale. This\n      lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part. No\n      crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which could be\n      distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its\n      banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than\n      sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so\n      perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the\n      true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no\n      little difficulty to determine. The trout, and some other varieties of\n      fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had\n      all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to\n      believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch\n      canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres\n      with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A\n      small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording\n      little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building,\n      seemingly a fowl-house—arose from the lake not far from its northern\n      shore—to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light-looking\n      and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick\n      plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the\n      interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch,\n      preventing all oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a\n      continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty\n      yards, finally passed through the “depression” (already described) in the\n      middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a\n      hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The lake was deep—at some points thirty feet—but the rivulet\n      seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its\n      bottom and banks were as those of the pond—if a defect could have\n      been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive\n      neatness.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an\n      occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball, or\n      the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums\n      blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in pots which\n      were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the appearance\n      of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn’s velvet was exquisitely\n      spotted with sheep—a considerable flock of which roamed about the\n      vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of\n      brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant\n      attendance upon these animals, each and all.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Along the eastern and western cliffs—where, toward the upper portion\n      of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous—grew\n      ivy in great profusion—so that only here and there could even a\n      glimpse of the naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like\n      manner, was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance;\n      some springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from\n      ledges on its face.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little\n      domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to prevent\n      the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was observable\n      elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:—any\n      stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of the\n      vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested, after a few\n      yards’ advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the\n      cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain. In\n      short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a rocky\n      pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I stopped to\n      reconnoitre the scene.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the\n      whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were\n      first from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the\n      stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a\n      peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the\n      sixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house—and\n      when I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek,\n      “etait d’une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,” I mean,\n      merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of\n      combined novelty and propriety—in a word, of poetry—(for, than\n      in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the\n      abstract, a more rigorous definition)—and I do not mean that merely\n      outre was perceptible in any respect.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In fact nothing could well be more simple—more utterly unpretending\n      than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic\n      arrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it, that\n      some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether,\n      although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house. I\n      will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it—from a position on\n      the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen broad—certainly\n      not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apex of the roof, could\n      not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end of this structure was\n      attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions:—the line\n      of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house,\n      and the line of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below\n      that of the roof adjoining. At right angles to these buildings, and from\n      the rear of the main one—not exactly in the middle—extended a\n      third compartment, very small—being, in general, one-third less than\n      the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were very steep—sweeping\n      down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve, and extending at least\n      four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to form the roofs of two\n      piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had\n      the air of needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at\n      the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension\n      of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief building and western wing\n      arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks,\n      alternately black and red:—a slight cornice of projecting bricks at\n      the top. Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:—in the\n      main building about four feet to the east and two to the west. The\n      principal door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the\n      east—while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not\n      extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual—they\n      had single shutters like doors—the panes were of lozenge form, but\n      quite large. The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge\n      panes—a movable shutter secured it at night. The door to the west\n      wing was in its gable, and quite simple—a single window looked out\n      to the south. There was no external door to the north wing, and it also\n      had only one window to the east.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a\n      balustrade) running diagonally across it—the ascent being from the\n      south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access\n      to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft—for it was lighted\n      only by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as\n      a store-room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is\n      usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs of\n      granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable footing\n      in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material—not nicely\n      adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the\n      stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about\n      five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to the\n      north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts\n      and catalpas.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead\n      trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in the\n      gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to\n      determine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms of\n      this tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker cylinder\n      with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a\n      third the impudent bobolink—while three or four more delicate\n      prisons were loudly vocal with canaries.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet\n      honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and its\n      west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.\n      Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof—then\n      to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe\n      on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it fairly\n      attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned\n      Dutch shingles—broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a\n      peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of\n      being wider at bottom than at top—after the manner of Egyptian\n      architecture; and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque\n      effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost\n      encompassed the base of the buildings.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this\n      neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that\n      partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an artist.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings were\n      seen at great advantage—for the southeastern angle was thrown\n      forward—so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,\n      with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a\n      sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof to\n      the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the brook\n      in the near vicinity of the main buildings.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough\n      to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear that I had\n      wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good traveller’s\n      excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at all events; so,\n      without more ado, I proceeded.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,\n      sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. It led\n      me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the bridge,\n      round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress, I took\n      notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in\n      stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held him\n      out my hand, however, in token of amity—and I never yet knew the dog\n      who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only shut his\n      mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his paw—afterward\n      extending his civilities to Ponto.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the door, which\n      stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the threshold—that\n      of a young woman about twenty-eight years of age—slender, or rather\n      slight, and somewhat above the medium height. As she approached, with a\n      certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable. I said to\n      myself, “Surely here I have found the perfection of natural, in\n      contradistinction from artificial grace.” The second impression which she\n      made on me, but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm.\n      So intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of\n      unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had never so\n      sunk into my heart of hearts before. I know not how it is, but this\n      peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself occasionally into the\n      lips, is the most powerful, if not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets\n      my interest in woman. “Romance,” provided my readers fully comprehended\n      what I would here imply by the word—“romance” and “womanliness” seem\n      to me convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is\n      simply her womanhood. The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the\n      interior call her “Annie, darling!”) were “spiritual grey;” her hair, a\n      light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of her.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At her most courteous of invitations, I entered—passing first into a\n      tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice\n      that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front of\n      the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room; while,\n      opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment, just the\n      size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large bow window\n      looking out to the north.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor—for this, I\n      afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in his manner,\n      but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements of the\n      dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal appearance of\n      the tenant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the\n      parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.\n      At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into\n      the west wing—probably a kitchen.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor.\n      On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture—a white\n      ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows were\n      curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung\n      decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor—just\n      to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great\n      delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running zig-zag\n      throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of Julien’s exquisite\n      lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall without frames. One of\n      these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness;\n      another was a “carnival piece,” spirited beyond compare; the third was a\n      Greek female head—a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an\n      expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my\n      attention.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs\n      (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather “settee;” its\n      material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped\n      with green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were “to match,” but\n      the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which\n      planned “the grounds;” it is impossible to conceive anything more\n      graceful.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      On the table were a few books; a large, square, crystal bottle of some\n      novel perfume; a plain ground glass <i>astral</i> (not solar) lamp with an\n      Italian shade; and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.\n      Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole\n      mere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with a\n      vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the\n      room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents. One\n      or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets clustered\n      about the open windows.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a\n      picture of Mr. Landor’s residence—as I found it.

The fair page now\n      lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has\n      been already too much an object for the scorn—for the horror—for\n      the detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not\n      the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all\n      outcasts most abandoned!—to the earth art thou not forever dead? to\n      its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?—and a cloud,\n      dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes\n      and heaven?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years\n      of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch—these\n      later years—took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude,\n      whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow\n      base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a\n      mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of\n      a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance—what\n      one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.\n      Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening\n      influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for\n      the sympathy—I had nearly said for the pity—of my fellow men.\n      I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the\n      slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish them to seek out\n      for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality\n      amid a wilderness of error. I would have them allow—what they cannot\n      refrain from allowing—that, although temptation may have erewhile\n      existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before—certainly,\n      never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered? Have\n      I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now dying a victim to\n      the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable\n      temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest\n      infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character.\n      As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many\n      reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive\n      injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices,\n      and a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset with\n      constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little\n      to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and\n      ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of\n      course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household\n      law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings,\n      I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name,\n      the master of my own actions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,\n      rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England, where\n      were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses\n      were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and\n      spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in fancy,\n      I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale\n      the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with\n      undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking,\n      each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky\n      atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner\n      experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its\n      concerns. Steeped in misery as I am—misery, alas! only too real—I\n      shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the\n      weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and\n      even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious\n      importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I\n      recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so\n      fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were extensive,\n      and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken\n      glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed the limit of\n      our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week—once every Saturday\n      afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief\n      walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields—and twice\n      during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the\n      morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of this\n      church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of\n      wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the\n      gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This\n      reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy\n      and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so\n      vast,—-could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in\n      snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of\n      the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was\n      riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron\n      spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never opened\n      save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already\n      mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude\n      of mystery—a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn\n      meditation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious\n      recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the\n      play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well\n      remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of\n      course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre,\n      planted with box and other shrubs, but through this sacred division we\n      passed only upon rare occasions indeed—such as a first advent to\n      school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend\n      having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or\n      Midsummer holidays.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the house!—how quaint an old building was this!—to me how\n      veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its windings—to\n      its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at any given time, to\n      say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. From\n      each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps\n      either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral branches were innumerable—inconceivable—and\n      so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to\n      the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we\n      pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was\n      never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the\n      little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty\n      other scholars.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The school-room was the largest in the house—I could not help\n      thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with\n      pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and\n      terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet,\n      comprising the sanctum, “during hours,” of our principal, the Reverend Dr.\n      Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which\n      in the absence of the “Dominie,” we would all have willingly perished by\n      the <i>peine forte et dure</i>. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far\n      less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these\n      was the pulpit of the “classical” usher, one of the “English and\n      mathematical.” Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in\n      endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient,\n      and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so\n      beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures,\n      and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what\n      little of original form might have been their portion in days long\n      departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and\n      a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet\n      not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life. The\n      teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to\n      occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was\n      replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from\n      luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first\n      mental development had in it much of the uncommon—even much of the\n      <i>outré</i>. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely\n      leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow—a\n      weak and irregular remembrance—an indistinct regathering of feeble\n      pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In childhood I\n      must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon\n      memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the <i>exergues</i> of the\n      Carthaginian medals.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet in fact—in the fact of the world’s view—how little was\n      there to remember! The morning’s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;\n      the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and\n      perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\n      intrigues;—these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\n      involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe\n      of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring.\n      “<i>Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my\n      disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and\n      by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all not\n      greatly older than myself;—over all with a single exception. This\n      exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation,\n      bore the same Christian and surname as myself;—a circumstance, in\n      fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was\n      one of those everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to\n      have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this\n      narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,—a\n      fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of\n      those who in school phraseology constituted “our set,” presumed to compete\n      with me in the studies of the class—in the sports and broils of the\n      play-ground—to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and\n      submission to my will—indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary\n      dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a supreme and\n      unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master-mind in boyhood\n      over the less energetic spirits of its companions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Wilson’s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; the\n      more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of\n      treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and\n      could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with\n      myself, a proof of his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me\n      a perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority—even this equality—was\n      in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some\n      unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his\n      competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged\n      interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. He\n      appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the\n      passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he\n      might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart,\n      astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not\n      help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique,\n      that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a\n      certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness\n      of manner. I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a\n      consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and\n      protection.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson’s conduct, conjoined with our\n      identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school\n      upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers,\n      among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire with\n      much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or\n      should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree,\n      connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must\n      have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby’s, I casually learned that\n      my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813—and this is\n      a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own\n      nativity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me\n      by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I\n      could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly\n      every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory,\n      he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had\n      deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on\n      his own, kept us always upon what are called “speaking terms,” while there\n      were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake\n      me in a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from\n      ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to\n      describe, my real feelings towards him. They formed a motley and\n      heterogeneous admixture;—some petulant animosity, which was not yet\n      hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy\n      curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition,\n      that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us, which\n      turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or\n      covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while\n      assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and\n      determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no means\n      uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted;\n      for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and\n      quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has\n      no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I\n      could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a\n      personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would\n      have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit’s end than myself;—my\n      rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him\n      from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of this\n      defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Wilson’s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his\n      practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first\n      discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I\n      never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the\n      annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its\n      very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my ears;\n      and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to\n      the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly\n      disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause\n      of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and\n      whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must\n      inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded\n      with my own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\n      circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my\n      rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we\n      were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I\n      perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person\n      and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a\n      relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,\n      nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously\n      concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,\n      person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason\n      to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in\n      the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject\n      of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed\n      it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he\n      could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can\n      only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary\n      penetration.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words\n      and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it was\n      an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without\n      difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my\n      voice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted,\n      but then the key—it was identical; <i>and his singular whisper, it grew the\n      very echo of my own</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not\n      justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe. I had\n      but one consolation—in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was\n      noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and\n      strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with having\n      produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret\n      over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful\n      of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might\n      have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his design,\n      perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many\n      anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his\n      copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my\n      security to the master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter,\n      (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit\n      of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage\n      which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference\n      with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of\n      advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it\n      with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this\n      distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can\n      recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of\n      those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming\n      inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents\n      and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, to-day,\n      have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected\n      the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too\n      cordially hated and too bitterly despised.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful\n      supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his\n      intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our\n      connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been\n      easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter months of my residence\n      at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond\n      doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar\n      proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw\n      this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an\n      altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown\n      off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather\n      foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his\n      accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first startled,\n      and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my\n      earliest infancy—wild, confused and thronging memories of a time\n      when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the sensation\n      which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off\n      the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before\n      me, at some epoch very long ago—some point of the past even\n      infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I\n      mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there\n      held with my singular namesake.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large\n      chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of\n      the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a\n      building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the odds\n      and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby\n      had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets,\n      they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. One of these\n      small apartments was occupied by Wilson.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately\n      after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one wrapped in sleep,\n      I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow\n      passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I had long been plotting\n      one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I\n      had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to\n      put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole\n      extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I\n      noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the\n      outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil\n      breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and\n      with it again approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in\n      the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright\n      rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon\n      his countenance. I looked;—and a numbness, an iciness of feeling\n      instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole\n      spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping\n      for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were\n      these—these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that\n      they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they\n      were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I\n      gazed;—while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent\n      thoughts. Not thus he appeared—assuredly not thus—in the\n      vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour of person!\n      the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and\n      meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was\n      it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw\n      was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic\n      imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the\n      lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of\n      that old academy, never to enter them again.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found\n      myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to\n      enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby’s, or at least to\n      effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I\n      remembered them. The truth—the tragedy—of the drama was no\n      more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom\n      called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity,\n      and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily\n      possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished\n      by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thoughtless\n      folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed\n      away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or\n      serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a\n      former existence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy\n      here—a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded\n      the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without\n      profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat\n      unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless\n      dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a\n      secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for\n      our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The wine\n      flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous\n      seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the\n      east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed\n      with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of\n      more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the\n      violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by\n      the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that some person,\n      apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted\n      than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me\n      to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there hung no\n      lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly\n      feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular window. As I put\n      my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about\n      my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the\n      novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the faint light\n      enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not\n      distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing\n      me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words\n      “William Wilson!” in my ear.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I grew perfectly sober in an instant.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake\n      of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light,\n      which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had\n      so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the\n      singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character,\n      the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered\n      syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days,\n      and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could\n      recover the use of my senses he was gone.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered\n      imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I\n      busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid\n      speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity\n      of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my\n      affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was\n      this Wilson?—and whence came he?—and what were his purposes?\n      Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in\n      regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal\n      from Dr. Bransby’s academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself\n      had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my\n      attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford.\n      Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me\n      with an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge\n      at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart,—to vie in\n      profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest\n      earldoms in Great Britain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke\n      forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of\n      decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to pause\n      in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts\n      I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel\n      follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then\n      usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly\n      fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the\n      vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in\n      his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing\n      my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my\n      fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very enormity\n      of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond\n      doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was\n      committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not\n      rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have\n      suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson—the\n      noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford—him whose follies (said\n      his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy—whose\n      errors but inimitable whim—whose darkest vice but a careless and\n      dashing extravagance?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came\n      to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning—rich, said\n      report, as Herodes Atticus—his riches, too, as easily acquired. I\n      soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting\n      subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,\n      with the gambler’s usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more\n      effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being\n      ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final\n      and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally\n      intimate with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a\n      remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had\n      contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was\n      solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear\n      accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself.\n      To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so\n      customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how\n      any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length\n      effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The\n      game, too, was my favorite <i>écarté!</i> The rest of the company, interested in\n      the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing\n      around us as spectators. The <i>parvenu</i>, who had been induced by my artifices\n      in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or\n      played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I\n      thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very\n      short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken\n      a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly\n      anticipating—he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.\n      With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated\n      refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique\n      to my compliance, did I finally comply. The result, of course, did but\n      prove how entirely the prey was in my toils: in less than an hour he had\n      quadrupled his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the\n      florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived\n      that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to my astonishment.\n      Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably\n      wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves\n      vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently\n      affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea\n      which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the\n      preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from\n      any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a\n      discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among\n      the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of\n      Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin\n      under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all,\n      should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable\n      condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and,\n      for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I could\n      not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn\n      or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even\n      own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted\n      from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued.\n      The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown\n      open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that\n      extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in\n      dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my\n      own height, and closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now\n      total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before\n      any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this\n      rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Gentlemen,” he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten\n      whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, “Gentlemen, I make\n      no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am but\n      fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character\n      of the person who has to-night won at <i>écarté</i> a large sum of money from\n      Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and\n      decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information. Please to\n      examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left\n      sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat\n      capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a\n      pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as abruptly\n      as he had entered. Can I—shall I describe my sensations? Must\n      I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had\n      little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the\n      spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the\n      lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in <i>écarté</i>,\n      and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those\n      used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the\n      species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly convex\n      at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this\n      disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack,\n      will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the\n      gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his\n      victim which may count in the records of the game.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less\n      than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was\n      received.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an\n      exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, “Mr. Wilson, this is your\n      property.” (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had\n      thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the\n      scene of play.) “I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the\n      folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your\n      skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of\n      quitting Oxford—at all events, of quitting instantly my chambers.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should\n      have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had\n      not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most\n      startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description\n      of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say.\n      Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious\n      to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature.\n      When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon\n      the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an\n      astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already\n      hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that\n      the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the\n      minutest possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously\n      exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been\n      worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of\n      myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by\n      Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a\n      resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a\n      hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror\n      and of shame.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and\n      proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet\n      only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of\n      the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew,\n      while I experienced no relief. Villain!—at Rome, with how untimely,\n      yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my\n      ambition! At Vienna, too—at Berlin—and at Moscow! Where, in\n      truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his\n      inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a\n      pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I\n      demand the questions “Who is he?—whence came he?—and what are\n      his objects?” But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with\n      a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of\n      his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon\n      which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of\n      the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he\n      so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those\n      actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter\n      mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so\n      imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so\n      pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period\n      of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his\n      whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the\n      execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any\n      moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, this, at least,\n      was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an instant,\n      have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton—in the destroyer of my\n      honor at Oxford,—in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge\n      at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my\n      avarice in Egypt,—that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, could\n      fail to recognise the William Wilson of my school boy days,—the\n      namesake, the companion, the rival,—the hated and dreaded rival at\n      Dr. Bransby’s? Impossible!—But let me hasten to the last eventful\n      scene of the drama.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The\n      sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated\n      character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence\n      of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other\n      traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto,\n      to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and\n      to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his\n      arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine;\n      and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and\n      more impatient of control. I began to murmur,—to hesitate,—to\n      resist. And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the\n      increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional\n      diminution? Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a\n      burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and\n      desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18—, that I attended a\n      masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had\n      indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now\n      the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond\n      endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the\n      company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was\n      anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young,\n      the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too\n      unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret\n      of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a\n      glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence. At\n      this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that\n      ever-remembered, low, damnable <i>whisper</i> within my ear.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus\n      interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired, as\n      I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a\n      Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt\n      sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Scoundrel!” I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I\n      uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, “scoundrel! impostor! accursed\n      villain! you shall not—you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me,\n      or I stab you where you stand!”—and I broke my way from the\n      ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him\n      unresistingly with me as I went.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the\n      wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He\n      hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence,\n      and put himself upon his defence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild\n      excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a\n      multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the\n      wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute\n      ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to\n      prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying\n      antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that\n      astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then\n      presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been\n      sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements\n      at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror,—so at first\n      it seemed to me in my confusion—now stood where none had been\n      perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror,\n      mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced\n      to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist—it was\n      Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution. His\n      mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not a thread\n      in all his raiment—not a line in all the marked and singular\n      lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute identity,\n      mine own!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have\n      fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>“You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead—dead\n      to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou exist—and, in\n      my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast\n      murdered thyself.”</i>\n</p>\n",
      "\n<h2><a id=\"chap2.20\"></a>THE TELL-TALE HEART.</h2>\n<p>\n      True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am;\n      but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not\n      destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.\n      I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in\n      hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how\n      calmly I can tell you the whole story.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once\n      conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion\n      there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never\n      given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye!\n      yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with\n      a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by\n      degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of\n      the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you\n      should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with\n      what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I\n      went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week\n      before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch\n      of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an\n      opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,\n      closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you\n      would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very,\n      very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me\n      an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see\n      him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this?\n      And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern\n      cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges\n      creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon\n      the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights—every night\n      just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was\n      impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but\n      his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into\n      the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a\n      hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he\n      would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every\n      night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the\n      door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before\n      that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I\n      could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was,\n      opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret\n      deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me;\n      for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I\n      drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick\n      darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,)\n      and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept\n      pushing it on steadily, steadily.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped\n      upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—“Who’s\n      there?”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a\n      muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still\n      sitting up in the bed listening;—just as I have done, night after\n      night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal\n      terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it was\n      the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when\n      overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at\n      midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom,\n      deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I\n      knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I\n      chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the\n      first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever\n      since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but\n      could not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but the wind\n      in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is\n      merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying\n      to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.\n      All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black\n      shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful\n      influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel—although\n      he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head within the\n      room.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie\n      down, I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the\n      lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily,\n      stealthily—until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the\n      spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon\n      it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a\n      hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could\n      see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the\n      ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but\n      over-acuteness of the sense?—now, I say, there came to my ears a\n      low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I\n      knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It\n      increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into\n      courage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the\n      lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the\n      eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker\n      and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror\n      must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do\n      you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at\n      the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house,\n      so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for\n      some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew\n      louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety\n      seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man’s\n      hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into\n      the room. He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to\n      the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find\n      the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a\n      muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard\n      through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the\n      bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my\n      hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no\n      pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the\n      wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned,\n      and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the\n      corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and\n      deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so\n      cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could\n      have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no\n      stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for\n      that. A tub had caught all—ha! ha!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still\n      dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at\n      the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,—for what\n      had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves,\n      with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard\n      by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;\n      information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers)\n      had been deputed to search the premises.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The\n      shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was\n      absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them\n      search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed\n      them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my\n      confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest\n      from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect\n      triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the\n      corpse of the victim.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was\n      singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted\n      of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished\n      them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still\n      they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:—it\n      continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the\n      feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness—until, at length,\n      I found that the noise was not within my ears.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      No doubt I now grew <i>very</i> pale;—but I talked more fluently,\n      and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could\n      I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch\n      makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the\n      officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but\n      the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high\n      key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why\n      would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides,\n      as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise\n      steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I\n      swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon\n      the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It\n      grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted\n      pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no,\n      no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were\n      making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But\n      anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this\n      derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I\n      must scream or die! and now—again!—hark! louder! louder!\n      louder! <i>louder!</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      “Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear\n      up the planks!—here, here!—It is the beating of his hideous heart!”\n     </p>\n",

The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreaching\n      the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of\n      that arch—as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching\n      the wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived\n      a type of unloveliness?—from the covenant of peace, a simile of\n      sorrow? But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out\n      of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of\n      to-day, or the agonies which <i>are</i>, have their origin in the\n      ecstasies which <i>might have been</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yet\n      there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,\n      hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and in\n      many striking particulars—in the character of the family mansion—in\n      the frescos of the chief saloon—in the tapestries of the dormitories—in\n      the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory—but more especially\n      in the gallery of antique paintings—in the fashion of the library\n      chamber—and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library’s\n      contents—there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the\n      belief.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,\n      and with its volumes—of which latter I will say no more. Here died\n      my mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had\n      not lived before—that the soul has no previous existence. You deny\n      it?—let us not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to\n      convince. There is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms—of\n      spiritual and meaning eyes—of sounds, musical yet sad—a\n      remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a shadow—vague,\n      variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow, too, in the\n      impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason\n      shall exist.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of what\n      seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy\n      land—into a palace of imagination—into the wild dominions of\n      monastic thought and erudition—it is not singular that I gazed\n      around me with a startled and ardent eye—that I loitered away my\n      boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it <i>is</i>\n      singular that as years rolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still\n      in the mansion of my fathers—it <i>is</i> wonderful what stagnation\n      there fell upon the springs of my life—wonderful how total an\n      inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought. The\n      realities of the world affected me as visions, and as visions only, while\n      the wild ideas of the land of dreams became, in turn, not the material of\n      my every-day existence, but in very deed that existence utterly and solely\n      in itself.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal halls.\n      Yet differently we grew—I, ill of health, and buried in gloom—she,\n      agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, the ramble on the\n      hill-side—mine the studies of the cloister; I, living within my own\n      heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intense and painful\n      meditation—she, roaming carelessly through life, with no thought of\n      the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours.\n      Berenice!—I call upon her name—Berenice!—and from the\n      gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at\n      the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of\n      her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic beauty! Oh,\n      sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its fountains! And\n      then—then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which should not be\n      told. Disease—a fatal disease, fell like the simoon upon her frame;\n      and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept over her,\n      pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a manner the\n      most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of her person!\n      Alas! the destroyer came and went!—and the victim—where is\n      she? I knew her not—or knew her no longer as Berenice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and\n      primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral\n      and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most distressing\n      and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not unfrequently\n      terminating in <i>trance</i> itself—trance very nearly resembling\n      positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery was in most\n      instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own disease—for I\n      have been told that I should call it by no other appellation—my own\n      disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac\n      character of a novel and extraordinary form—hourly and momently\n      gaining vigor—and at length obtaining over me the most\n      incomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it,\n      consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in\n      metaphysical science termed the <i>attentive</i>. It is more than probable\n      that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner\n      possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate\n      idea of that nervous <i>intensity of interest</i> with which, in my case,\n      the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried\n      themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the\n      universe.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some\n      frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to become\n      absorbed, for the better part of a summer’s day, in a quaint shadow\n      falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose myself, for an\n      entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a\n      fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat,\n      monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent\n      repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to lose all\n      sense of motion or physical existence, by means of absolute bodily\n      quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such were a few of the most\n      common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental\n      faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding\n      defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid attention\n      thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must not be\n      confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all\n      mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination.\n      It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme condition, or\n      exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct\n      and different. In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being\n      interested by an object usually <i>not</i> frivolous, imperceptibly loses\n      sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing\n      therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day-dream <i>often replete with\n      luxury</i>, he finds the <i>incitamentum</i>, or first cause of his\n      musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the primary object\n      was <i>invariably frivolous</i>, although assuming, through the medium of\n      my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance. Few deductions,\n      if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the\n      original object as a centre. The meditations were <i>never</i>\n      pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first cause, so\n      far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated\n      interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In a word, the\n      powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as I have said\n      before, the <i>attentive</i>, and are, with the day-dreamer, the <i>speculative</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the\n      disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative and\n      inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the disorder\n      itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the noble Italian,\n      Coelius Secundus Curio, “<i>De Amplitudine Beati Regni Dei;</i>” St.\n      Austin’s great work, the “City of God;” and Tertullian’s “<i>De Carne\n      Christi</i>,” in which the paradoxical sentence “<i>Mortuus est Dei\n      filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est\n      quia impossibile est,</i>” occupied my undivided time, for many weeks of\n      laborious and fruitless investigation.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial things,\n      my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by Ptolemy\n      Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence, and\n      the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled only to the touch\n      of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to a careless thinker, it\n      might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the alteration produced by her\n      unhappy malady, in the <i>moral</i> condition of Berenice, would afford me\n      many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation\n      whose nature I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not\n      in any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her\n      calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that total\n      wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fail to ponder, frequently\n      and bitterly, upon the wonder-working means by which so strange a\n      revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass. But these reflections\n      partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease, and were such as would have\n      occurred, under similar circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind.\n      True to its own character, my disorder revelled in the less important but\n      more startling changes wrought in the <i>physical</i> frame of Berenice—in\n      the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had\n      never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with me,\n      <i>had never been</i> of the heart, and my passions <i>always were</i> of\n      the mind. Through the gray of the early morning—among the trellised\n      shadows of the forest at noonday—and in the silence of my library at\n      night—she had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her—not as\n      the living and breathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as\n      a being of the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not\n      as a thing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as the\n      theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And <i>now</i>—now\n      I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet, bitterly\n      lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to mind that she had\n      loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her of marriage.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon an\n      afternoon in the winter of the year—one of those unseasonably warm,\n      calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon (*1),—I\n      sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of the\n      library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before me.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Was it my own excited imagination—or the misty influence of the\n      atmosphere—or the uncertain twilight of the chamber—or the\n      gray draperies which fell around her figure—that caused in it so\n      vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no\n      word; and I—not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy\n      chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me;\n      a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I\n      remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted\n      upon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige\n      of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning\n      glances at length fell upon the face.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the once\n      jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow temples\n      with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarring\n      discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy\n      of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and seemingly\n      pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the\n      contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile\n      of peculiar meaning, <i>the teeth</i> of the changed Berenice disclosed\n      themselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them,\n      or that, having done so, I had died!\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my\n      cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber of\n      my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away, the white\n      and ghastly <i>spectrum</i> of the teeth. Not a speck on their surface—not\n      a shade on their enamel—not an indenture in their edges—but\n      what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I\n      saw them <i>now</i> even more unequivocally than I beheld them <i>then</i>.\n      The teeth!—the teeth!—they were here, and there, and\n      everywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and\n      excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very\n      moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full fury of my\n      <i>monomania</i>, and I struggled in vain against its strange and\n      irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external world I\n      had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied\n      desire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in\n      their single contemplation. They—they alone were present to the\n      mental eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of\n      my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every\n      attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their\n      peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the\n      alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in\n      imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by\n      the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it has\n      been well said, “<i>Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments</i>,” and of\n      Berenice I more seriously believed <i>que toutes ses dents etaient des\n      idées</i>. <i>Des idées!</i>—ah here was the idiotic thought that\n      destroyed me! <i>Des idées!</i>—ah, <i>therefore</i> it was that I\n      coveted them so madly! I felt that their possession could alone ever\n      restore me to peace, in giving me back to reason.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And the evening closed in upon me thus—and then the darkness came,\n      and tarried, and went—and the day again dawned—and the mists\n      of a second night were now gathering around—and still I sat\n      motionless in that solitary room—and still I sat buried in\n      meditation—and still the <i>phantasma</i> of the teeth maintained\n      its terrible ascendancy, as, with the most vivid hideous distinctness, it\n      floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber. At\n      length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and\n      thereunto, after a pause, succeeded the sound of troubled voices,\n      intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my\n      seat, and throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out\n      in the ante-chamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that\n      Berenice was—no more! She had been seized with epilepsy in the early\n      morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the grave was ready for\n      its tenant, and all the preparations for the burial were completed.\n    </p>\n<hr>\n<p>\n      I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It\n      seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream. I\n      knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the\n      setting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary period\n      which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite comprehension.\n      Yet its memory was replete with horror—horror more horrible from\n      being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful\n      page in the record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous,\n      and unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in vain;\n      while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound, the shrill and\n      piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears. I had\n      done a deed—what was it? I asked myself the question aloud, and the\n      whispering echoes of the chamber answered me,—“<i>What was it?</i>”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It was\n      of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for it\n      was the property of the family physician; but how came it <i>there</i>,\n      upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were in\n      no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open\n      pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the\n      singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:—“<i>Dicebant mihi\n      sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore\n      levatas</i>.” Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect\n      themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my\n      veins?\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There came a light tap at the library door—and, pale as the tenant\n      of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,\n      and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said\n      he?—some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing\n      the silence of the night—of the gathering together of the household—of\n      a search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew\n      thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave—of a\n      disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing—still palpitating—<i>still\n      alive</i>!\n    </p>\n<p>\n      He pointed to garments;—they were muddy and clotted with gore. I\n      spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the\n      impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some object against\n      the wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a shriek I\n      bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I could\n      not force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell\n      heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there\n      rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with\n      thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered\n      to and fro about the floor.\n    </p>\n",

Men\n      have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness\n      is or is not the loftiest intelligence—whether much that is glorious—whether\n      all that is profound—does not spring from disease of thought—from\n      moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who\n      dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream\n      only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and\n      thrill, in awakening, to find that they have been upon the verge of the\n      great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of\n      good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate,\n      however, rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the “light\n      ineffable,” and again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer,\n      “agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two\n      distinct conditions of my mental existence—the condition of a lucid\n      reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming\n      the first epoch of my life—and a condition of shadow and doubt,\n      appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes\n      the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the\n      earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give\n      only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt it\n      ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly\n      these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother\n      long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had always dwelled\n      together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.\n      No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a\n      range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the\n      sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was trodden in its vicinity;\n      and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force,\n      the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death\n      the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we\n      lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley—I,\n      and my cousin, and her mother.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our\n      encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than\n      all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy\n      courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills\n      still dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the “River of\n      Silence”; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow. No\n      murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the\n      pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom,\n      stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old\n      station, shining on gloriously forever.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided\n      through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that extended\n      from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they\n      reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,—these spots, not less than\n      the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that\n      girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short,\n      perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with\n      the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red\n      asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones, of\n      the love and of the glory of God.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of\n      dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not\n      upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day\n      into the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with the vivid\n      alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the\n      cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge\n      leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying\n      with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria\n      doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with Eleonora\n      before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at the close of\n      the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat,\n      locked in each other’s embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked\n      down within the water of the River of Silence at our images therein. We\n      spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon\n      the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from that\n      wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of\n      our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries distinguished our\n      race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally\n      noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the\n      Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant\n      flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been\n      known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by\n      one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten\n      by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life arose in our paths; for the tall\n      flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his\n      scarlet plumage before us. The golden and silver fish haunted the river,\n      out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled,\n      at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of\n      Æolus—sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a\n      voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of Hesper,\n      floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in\n      peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested\n      upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into\n      magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a magic\n      prison-house of grandeur and of glory.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a maiden\n      artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers. No\n      guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart, and she\n      examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the Valley\n      of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty changes which had\n      lately taken place therein.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change which\n      must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful\n      theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard\n      of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and again, in every\n      impressive variation of phrase.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom—that, like\n      the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but\n      the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she\n      revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of\n      Silence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of\n      the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,\n      transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden\n      of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself\n      hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to\n      Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of\n      Earth—that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory,\n      or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me.\n      And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious\n      solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a\n      saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a\n      penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make\n      record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my\n      words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her\n      breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance\n      of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made easy to her the\n      bed of her death. And she said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly\n      dying, that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she\n      would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were\n      permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if\n      this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that\n      she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing\n      upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with\n      perfume from the censers of the angels. And, with these words upon her\n      lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch\n      of my own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time’s path,\n      formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second era of my\n      existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I mistrust the\n      perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.—Years dragged\n      themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the\n      Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. The\n      star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no\n      more. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red\n      asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by\n      ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever\n      encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tall\n      flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew sadly\n      from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had\n      arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam down through\n      the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river\n      never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer than the\n      wind-harp of Æolus, and more divine than all save the voice of Eleonora,\n      it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until\n      the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its\n      original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and,\n      abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell back into\n      the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous\n      glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds of\n      the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume\n      floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart\n      beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft\n      sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once—oh,\n      but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death,\n      by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed\n      for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the\n      valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for ever\n      for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served\n      to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the\n      Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately\n      court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women,\n      bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved true to\n      its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given\n      me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they\n      ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood aghast at\n      the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible temptations which\n      beset me; for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into\n      the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole\n      recreant heart yielded at once—at whose footstool I bowed down\n      without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of\n      love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in\n      comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting\n      ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole soul in tears at the\n      feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?—Oh, bright was the seraph\n      Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none other. Oh,\n      divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into the depths of\n      her memorial eyes, I thought only of them—and of her.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      I wedded—nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness\n      was not visited upon me. And once—but once again in the silence of\n      the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken\n      me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Sleep in peace! for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in\n      taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,\n      for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto\n      Eleonora.”\n     </p>\n",

It consists of several\n      hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some trees, now\n      growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for natural\n      philosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory of\n      petrification.—<i>Kennedy</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by the\n      discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of the\n      Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of the\n      rocky chain.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe more\n      remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view than that\n      presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller, having\n      passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the city,\n      proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road across the\n      desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren\n      valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide\n      had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills, which has for\n      some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now presented to him is\n      beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of fragments of trees, all\n      converted into stone, and when struck by his horse’s hoof ringing like\n      cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the\n      form of a decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue,\n      but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to fifteen\n      feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in thickness, strewed\n      so closely together, as far as the eye can reach, that an Egyptian donkey\n      can scarcely thread its way through amongst them, and so natural that,\n      were it in Scotland or Ireland, it might pass without remark for some\n      enormous drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun.\n      The roots and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly\n      perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily\n      recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the finer\n      portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire, and bear to be\n      examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole are so thoroughly\n      silicified as to scratch glass and are capable of receiving the highest\n      polish.— <i>Asiatic Magazine</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*4) In Iceland, 1783.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*5) “During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind produced\n      such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than fifty\n      leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by groping.\n      During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, at Caserta, four leagues\n      distant, people could only walk by the light of torches. On the first of\n      May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming from a volcano in\n      the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes, spreading over\n      it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open air, one could not\n      perceive the trees or other objects near him, or even a white handkerchief\n      placed at the distance of six inches from the eye.<i>“—Murray, p.\n      215, Phil. edit.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n      (*6) In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a portion of\n      the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred yards in diameter, and\n      from eighty to a hundred feet deep.

A grain of silex is also a “rock.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      (*10) The <i>Epidendron, Flos Aeris,</i> of the family of the <i>Orchideae</i>,\n      grows with merely the surface of its roots attached to a tree or other\n      object, from which it derives no nutriment—subsisting altogether\n      upon air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*11) The <i>Parasites,</i> such as the wonderful <i>Rafflesia Arnaldii</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*12) <i>Schouw</i> advocates a class of plants that grow upon living\n      animals—the <i>Plantae</i> <i>Epizoae</i>. Of this class are the <i>Fuci</i>\n      and <i>Algae</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n<i>Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass.</i>, presented the “National\n      Institute” with an insect from New Zealand, with the following\n      description: “‘<i>The Hotte</i>, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is found\n      gnawing at the root of the <i>Rota</i> tree, with a plant growing out of\n      its head. This most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the\n      <i>Rota</i> and <i>Ferriri</i> trees, and entering into the top, eats its\n      way, perforating the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root, and\n      dies, or remains dormant, and the plant propagates out of its head; the\n      body remains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive.\n      From this insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous <i>fungus</i>\n      that emits an intense phosphorescence.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*15) The corolla of this flower (<i>Aristolochia Clematitis</i>), which\n      is tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into a\n      globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset with\n      stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the pistil,\n      which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the\n      surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,\n      cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the\n      flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without\n      some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down to\n      the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished in this\n      case, is that of the <i>Tiputa Pennicornis</i>, a small insect, which\n      entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to the\n      bottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen; but\n      not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downward position\n      of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap,\n      and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and\n      forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing the\n      stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impregnation, in\n      consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop, and the hairs to\n      shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy passage for the escape\n      of the insect.”—<i>Rev. P. Keith-System of Physiological Botany</i>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*16) The bees—ever since bees were—have been constructing\n      their cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such\n      inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the\n      profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the very\n      number, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the most\n      room that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      During the latter part of the last century, the question arose among\n      mathematicians—“to determine the best form that can be given to the\n      sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the\n      revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revolution.” This\n      is an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to find the\n      best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at an\n      infinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to\n      answer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and\n      when at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that the\n      wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since the first\n      bird had traversed the air.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort and the\n      Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took up four hours in\n      passing, which, at the rate of one mile per minute, gives a length of 240\n      miles; and, supposing three pigeons to each square yard, gives\n      2,230,272,000 Pigeons.—“<i>Travels in Canada and the United States,”\n       by Lieut.

If two red rays from two\n      luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall on a white\n      surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch, their\n      intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be any\n      whole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &amp;c.,\n      gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3 1/2,\n      &amp;c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similar\n      effects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and\n      with all other rays the results are the same—the difference varying\n      with a uniform increase from the violet to the red.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      “Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      (*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a red heat;\n      pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile of bodies at\n      a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixed in a hot\n      crucible, and not a drop evaporates—being surrounded by an\n      atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few drops\n      of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in contact\n      with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous acid vapor,\n      and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water passes off\n      with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking advantage of\n      the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned out a lump of\n      ice from a red-hot vessel.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*33) The Daguerreotype.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distance of 61\n      Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is so inconceivably\n      great, that its rays would require more than ten years to reach the earth.\n      For stars beyond this, 20—or even 1000 years—would be a\n      moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000 years\n      ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which started from their\n      surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which we see daily\n      are really extinct, is not impossible—not even improbable.\n    </p>\n<h3>Notes—Maelstrom</h3>\n<p>\n      (*1) See Archimedes, “<i>De Incidentibus in Fluido</i>.”—lib. 2.\n    </p>\n<h3>Notes—Island of the Fay</h3>\n<p>\n      (*1) Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is “fashionable”\n       or more strictly “of manners.”\n     </p>\n<p>\n      (*2) Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise “De Situ\n      Orbis,” says “either the world is a great animal, or” etc\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*3) Balzac—in substance—I do not remember the words\n    </p>\n<p>\n      (*4) Florem putares nare per liquidum aethera.—P.
